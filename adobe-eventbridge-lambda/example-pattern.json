This pattern is leveraging the Adobe I/O Evenets Amazon EventBridge integration to send order events from the customer's Adobe account to their AWS account, via an Amazon EventBridge Partner event bus. Once the Adobe I/O events are in the customer's account, an Amazon EventBridge rule routes updated product events to a downstream Lambda function.",
