# Application Load balancer with AWS Lambda as target with Pulumi

This pattern demonstrates how to create an Application Load Balancer with AWS Lambda as target. Implemented in Pulumi.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
* [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd alb-lambda-pulumi-ts
    ```
1. Run below command to install required dependancies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
1. Set the region that you want to deploy the load balancer and Lambda function to:
    ```
    pulumi config set aws:region {region}
    ```
1. From the command line, run:
    ```
    pulumi up
    ```

## Testing

1. In the stack output, you can see `url`. To access this using the Pulumi CLI you can run `curl $(pulumi stack output url)`.

** Please note: Application Load Balancer's default settings for health check are 5 consecutive health check successes with 35 seconds interval. So, it will take couple of minutes for the target to be healthy.

## Cleanup
 
1. To delete the stack, run:
    ```bash
    pulumi destroy
    ```
