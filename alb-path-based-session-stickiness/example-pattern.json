      "This sample project demonstrates how to set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with path-based session stickiness using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). The ALB routes traffic to different target groups based on the request path.",
      "The project creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets, an ALB, and two target groups (one for each path). It also deploys two Lambda functions, each associated with a different target group.",
      "When a client sends a request to a specific path (e.g., /app1), the ALB forwards the request to the corresponding target group and Lambda function. Subsequent requests from the same client session are routed to the same target group, ensuring session stickiness."
