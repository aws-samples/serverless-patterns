            "This pattern first creates a CodeCommit repository from the web application code in the local folder 'local-webapp-code'. Then it creates an Amplify app using the CodeCommit repository as the source repository. Finally, it creates a Custom Resource that creates an Amplify job to build and deploy the Amplify app.",
