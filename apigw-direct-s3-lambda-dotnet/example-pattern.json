        "This pattern shows how to create an Amazon API Gateway REST API with a direct proxy to an Amazon S3 bucket. The API allows files to be uploaded to the S3 bucket. An AWS Lambda authorizer authorizes the incoming HTTP requests. The S3 upload asynchronously triggers a Lambda function to process the uploaded file.",
        "An Amazon API Gateway REST API is deployed, one AWS Lambda Authorizer, one Amazon S3 bucket, and one AWS Lambda that will be triggered after a file is uploaded.",
        "The Amazon API Gateway is defined in the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template.yaml file using the OpenAPI specification."
