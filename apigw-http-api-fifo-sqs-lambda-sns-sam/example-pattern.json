      "This pattern is designed to deploy an Amazon API Gateway HTTP API with a single route at \"/\"",
      "When the API Gateway receives a request from a client, it immediately sends the message to a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.",
      "The FIFO queue ensures that messages are processed in the order they were received, maintaining strict ordering",
      "As the messages arrive in the FIFO queue, it automatically invokes a Lambda function responsible for message processing",
      "The Lambda function handles each message one by one in FIFO order.",
      "Depending on the use case, the Lambda may perform various actions, such as data processing, validation, or invoking other AWS services.",
      
      "Once the Lambda function has processed a message, it publishes the relevant information or processed data to an SNS (Simple Notification Service) standard topic.",
      "You can then Subscribe email addresses to the topic to be notified through the SNS topic, providing users with timely updates or notifications via email."
