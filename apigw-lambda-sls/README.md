# Amazon API Gateway REST API with AWS Lambda proxy integration

This pattern in Serverless Framework offers a boilerlate to generate an Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoint with a greedy proxy ("{proxy+}") and "ANY" method from the specified path, meaning it will accept by default any method and any path. The Lambda function, provided in TypeScript, only returns the path.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version) installed
* [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:

    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```

1. Change directory to the pattern directory its source code folder:

    ``` sh
        cd serverless-patterns/apigw-lambda-sls
    ```

1. From the command line, use npm to install the development dependencies:

    ``` sh
    npm install
    ```

1. To deploy from the command line use the following:

    ``` sh
    serverless deploy --verbose
    ```

    The above command will deploy resources to `us-east-1` region by default. You can override the target region with `--region <region>` CLI option, e.g.

    ``` sh
    serverless deploy --verbose --region us-west-2
    ```

1. Note the `ServiceEndpoint` output from the deployment process. You will use this value for testing.

## Testing

1. After deployment, the output shows the API Gateway URL with the Lambda integration, for example: `ServiceEndpoint: https://<random-id>.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/`.
1. Accessing the URL in a browser, you see: `Hello Serverless Citizen, your happy path is: "/"`.
1. This page logs any path you type after "/". You can use this as a starting point as a general purpose endpoint for various types of applications. That said, you can try adding extra path to the `ServiceEndpoint` URL and confirm it being reported back to the user, e.g. navigating to `<ServiceEndpoint>/aaa/bbb/ccc` URL results in `Hello Serverless Citizen, your happy path is: "/aaa/bbb/ccc"` returned to the user.

## Cleanup

1. Delete the stack

    ```sh
    serverless remove --verbose
    ```

1. Confirm the stack has been deleted

    ```sh
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'apigw-lambda-sls-prod')].StackStatus"
    ```

    Expected output

    ```json
    [
        "DELETE_COMPLETE"
    ]
    ```

    NOTE: You might need to add `--region <region>` option to AWS CLI command if you AWS CLI default region does not match the one, that you used for the Serverless Framework deployment.
