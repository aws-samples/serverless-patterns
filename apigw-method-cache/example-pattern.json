        "Any requests made within this 10 second period will be a cache hit and the cached response will be returned by API Gateway immediately without invoking the Lambda integration.",
        "The Lambda integration returns a timestamp in the header so that it is easy to visualize whether a particular response is being returned as a cached response or as a response from the Lambda integration."
