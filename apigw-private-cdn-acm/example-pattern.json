    "1. Private Certificate Authority and API Gateway Setup\n  1. Creates an PCA\n  2. Issue a root certificate through the PCA\n  3. Create a certificate in ACM using PCA's root certificate\n  4. Create a private REST API in API gateway\n  5. Associate the ACM certificate with API Gateway's private custom domain\n  6. Configure a Lambda function as the API Gateway backend processor\n  7. Deploys a private REST API through API Gateway\n  8. Associate the custom domain with the API Gateway stage",
    "2. VPC Endpoints configurations for private communication:\n  1. 'acm-pca' VPC Endpoint - Facilitates communication with PCA\n  2. 'execute-api' VPC Endpoint - Provides private access to the REST API",
    "3. DNS Configuration\n    1. Establish a private hosted zone for the domain name\n    2. Creates a CNAME record within the hosted zone for custom domain name\n    3. Points API Gateway's private custom domain name to the 'execute-api' VPC Endpoint DNS name"
