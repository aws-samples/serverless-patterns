This template includes an response streaming-enabled Amazon API Gateway REST API that invokes a Python Lambda function, which uses Lambda Web Adaptor with Fast API to enable response streaming.",
      "To enable response streaming with a Python Lambda function, we use [Lambda Web Adaptor](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-response-streaming-with-aws-lambda-web-adapter-to-optimize-performance/) and [Fast API](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter/tree/main/examples/fastapi-response-streaming-zip).",
