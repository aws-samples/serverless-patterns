      "In this pattern, called Queue based leveling, a serverless queue is introduced between your API Gateway and your workers, a Lambda function in this case.",
      "The queue acts as a buffer to alleviate traffic spikes and ensure your workload can sustain the arriving load by buffering all the requests durably.",
      "It also helps downstream consumers to process the incoming requests at a consistent pace."
