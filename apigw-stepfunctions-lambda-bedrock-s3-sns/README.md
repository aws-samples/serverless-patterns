# Video generation via ApiGateway -> StepFunctions -> Lambda -> Bedrock -> S3 -> SNS

![architecture](architecture/architecture.png)

This pattern demonstrates how to generate state-of-art videos with a serverless workflow using Amazon Bedrock [Nova Reel model](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-nova-artificial-intelligence-bedrock-aws) and uploads the videos to Amazon S3. The pattern also publishes an email to user with the Pre-Signed URL once the generated video is ready in S3 bucket. The user email address needs to be provided while deploying the application through parameter.

Note: this pattern includes lambda function deployment package with a custom version of boto3. Using an outdated boto3 version will result in an API not supported error.


Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

### Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) installed
* [Amazon Bedrock Nova Reel Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html#add-model-access)

## Amazon Bedrock setup instructions
You must request access to Amazon Nova Reel model before you can use it. If you try to use the model (with the API or console) before you have requested access to it, you receive an error message. For more information, see [Model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).

1. In the AWS console, select the region from which you want to access Amazon Bedrock. At the time of writing, Amazon Bedrock is available in us-east-1 (N. Virginia) and us-west-2 (Oregon) regions.

1. Find **Amazon Bedrock** by searching in the AWS console.

    ![Bedrock Search](bedrock_setup/bedrock-search.png)

1. Expand the side menu.

1. From the side menu, select **Model access**.

1. Select the **Edit** button.

6. Use the checkboxes to select the models you wish to enable. Review the applicable EULAs as needed. Click **Save changes** to activate the models in your account. For this pattern we only need Nova Reel /  model id: amazon.nova-reel-v1:0.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd serverless-patterns/apigw-stepfunctions-lambda-bedrock-s3-sns
    ```
1. Create virtual environment for Python
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
    For a Windows platform, activate the virtualenv like this:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
    For a OSX / Linux platform, activate the virtualenv like this:
    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
1. Install the Python required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. Run the command below to bootstrap your account. CDK needs it to deploy
    ```
    cdk bootstrap
    ```
1. Review the CloudFormation template CDK generates for you stack using the following AWS CDK CLI command:
    ```
    cdk synth
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS CDK to deploy the AWS resources.
    ```
    cdk deploy --parameters EmailParameter=replace-your-email-here@example.com
    ```
1. After deployment completes, you will receive an email to the Inbox of email provided in above step. This email is to confirm the subscription of this email to the SNS Topic. Click on the confirm subscription link and you will receive a message that subscription is successful as below.
    
    ![Email Subscription Success](sns_subscription/subscription-successful-view.png)

1. Take a look at the Outputs section after the CDK deployment completes. There will be an entry containing the URL of the API Gateway resource you just created. Copy that URL as you'll need it for your tests.

    The format of the URL will be something like `https://{id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/prod`


## How it works

CDK will create an API Gateway, along with a resource and a POST method. This method starts execution of a StateMachine workflow. The Workflow will trigger a Lambda function that takes the prompt and invokes Amazon Bedrock Nova Reel model asynchronously. StateMachine workflow triggers another Lambda function that checks wether video is uploaded and ready in S3 bucket. Once the video is ready in S3, a Pre-Signed URL will be generated and pushed to SNS Topic. The SNS Topic then publishes an email to user with Pre-Signed URL for the video generated by Nova Reel model.


## Testing

We'll be making requests to the *generateVideo* endpoint with a desired prompt.

Follow the example below and replace `{your-api-url}` with your api url from step 9. 

    ```
    curl -X POST \
    {your-api-url}/prod/generateVideo \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt": "video of a car made up of fruits"}'
    ```

## Review results

Within 4-5 minutes, you would be receiving an email with S3 Pre-Signed URL. Enter the complete Pre-Signed URL into browser to download the generated Video. Additionally, you can also go to Amazon S3 bucket to view the newly upload Video. 

Here is an example generated video:
![Generated video of Niagara Waterfalls](example/generated_video_example.mp4)

## Cleanup
 
1. Run below script in the `apigw-stepfunctions-lambda-bedrock-s3-sns` directory to delete AWS resources created by this sample stack.
    ```bash
    cdk destroy
    ```
