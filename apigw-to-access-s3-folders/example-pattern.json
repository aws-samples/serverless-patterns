      "This would be helpful in reducing the latency of API requests, use API Gateway without a Lambda function to read Amazon S3 bucket resources. This method can also reduce costs and make your system easier to maintain and troubleshoot",
      "Please make sure the API Gateway and S3 bucket are deployed in the same region."
