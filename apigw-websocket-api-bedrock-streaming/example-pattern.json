        "This sample project demonstrates how to use WebSocket API as a front door to Lambda functions that perform inference on Amazon Bedrock LLMs using the [InvokeModelWithResponseStream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithResponseStream.html) API, where the LLM responses are returned in a stream.",
        "With WebSocket API, developers of interactive LLM chatbot interfaces can provide a better user experience by displaying the LLM responses as they are generated (which at times can be long), rather than relying on the synchronous [InvokeModel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.html) API request.",
        "This pattern deploys one API Gateway WebSocket API, four Lambda functions, and one DynamoDB table."
