      "This pattern creates an Amazon API Gateway WebSocket API which sends inbound messages to an Amazon SQS FIFO queue. The queue is processed by an AWS Lambda function to return a result.",
      "The queue acts as a buffer to alleviate traffic spikes and ensure your workload can sustain the arriving load by buffering all the requests durably. It also helps downstream consumers to process the incoming requests at a consistent pace. A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue is used to ensure that evens are processed in order of arrival."
