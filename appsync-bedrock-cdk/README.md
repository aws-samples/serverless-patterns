# AWS AppSync to Amazon Bedrock

This pattern shows how to invoke Amazon Bedrock models from AppSync via HTTP resolvers.

Learn more about this pattern at Serverless Land Patterns: https://serverlessland.com/patterns/appsync-bedrock

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
* [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html) (AWS CDK) installed
* Make sure to enable the **Anthropic - Claude V2** model on the [Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess).


## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd appsync-bedrock-cdk
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Deploy the stack to your default AWS account and region:
    ```
    cdk deploy
    ```

## How it works

In this pattern the end user is able to provide a prompt that will be used to invoke an Amazon Bedrock model from the JS resolver.
It is possible to augment the integration by adding functions in the pipeline resolver and change the invoked model by inserting the relative inference parameters in the JS resolver.

## Testing

Provide steps to trigger the integration and show what should be observed if successful.

1. Generate code for invoking the API (if you changed the schema):
    ```
    npx @aws-amplify/cli codegen add --apiId <GraphQLApiID> --region <Region>
    ```

2. Input the API parameters in [backend.test.ts](test/backend.test.ts)
    ```ts
        Amplify.configure({
            aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint:
            '<GraphQLApiURL>',
            aws_appsync_region: '<Region>',
            aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'API_KEY',
            aws_appsync_apiKey: '<GraphQLApiKey>'
        })
    ```

3. Run tests
    ```
    nom run test
    ```

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    cdk destroy --all
    ```
