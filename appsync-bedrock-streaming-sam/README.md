# Amazon DynamoDB Streams to AWS AppSync Subscription

This pattern creates an AppSync API to invoke an Amazon Bedrock model (here Anthropic Claude V3 Haiku) through a mutation and a subscription to listen for the response.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed
* Make sure to enable the **Anthropic - Claude V3 Haiku** model on the [Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess).

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd appsync-bedrock-streaming-sam
    ```
3. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam build
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
4. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

## How it works

This template creates an AWS AppSync API along with an AWS Lambda function. The API exposes a mutation that will asynchronously invoke a Lambda function, thus bypassing the 30s timeout of AppSync, to call Anthropic Claude V3 Haiku through Amazon Bedrock and stream the response back to the end user through an AppSync subscription.

## Testing

The easiest way to test the AppSync API is with the [AppSync console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync/home#/apis). Ensure you select the same region where you deployed this pattern.

1. Select the API you created, named `BedrockAppSyncApi`, then choose the Queries from the navigation pane.
2. Subscribe to `onMessage` as follows.
  ```graphql
  subscription MySubscription {
    onMessage (chatId: "test") {
      messageId
      type
      fullText
    }
  }
  ```
3. Choose Run.
4. In another browser tab, open a second Queries page.
5. Run the `sendMessage` mutation as follows
  ```graphql
  mutation MyMutation {
    sendMessage(
      chatId: "test", 
      prompt: "Does AppSync support streaming responses ?"
    )
  }
  ```
6. Choose Run.
7. Switch back to your subscription tab and observe the streaming response.

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
  ```bash
  sam delete
  ```
