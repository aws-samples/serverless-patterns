# AWS AppSync to Amazon Bedrock

This pattern shows how to invoke Amazon Bedrock models from AppSync through HTTP resolvers.

Why? This pattern can be used as a starting point to leverage AWS AppSync pipeline resolvers and Amazon Bedrock. In your pipeline resolver, you could for example first fetch some information from another datasource (external API, database, ...) and use the information returned by this datasource to include it in your prompts when invoking Amazon Bedrock models. With pipeline resolvers, you do not need to call (and therefore pay for) compute resources (such as Lambda functions) to perform this logic.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed
* Make sure to enable the **Anthropic - Claude Instant** model on the [Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/modelaccess).

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd appsync-bedrock
    ```
3. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
4. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region (choose a region where [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is currently available)
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

## How it works

In this pattern the end user is able to provide a query and a role. Based on the role provided (philosopher, schoolteacher or politician), a specific context will be added to the prompt used to invoke an Amazon Bedrock model from within the JS resolver.

## Testing

1. Visit the [AppSync on the AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync/home#/apis) in the region you deployed this sample in.
2. Select the AppSync API called AppSyncToBedrockApi
3. From the left pane, click on **Queries**

4. Fill in the following query and run it:
   ```graphql
    mutation MyMutation {
        invokeModel(query: "How is bread baked?", role: "schoolteacher") {
            output
        }
    }
   ```
   In this query we are providing the **schoolteacher** role. The expected output should take this role into consideration.

5. Now let's run the same query with a **philosopher** role.
    ```graphql
    mutation MyMutation {
        invokeModel(query: "How is bread baked?", role: "philosopher") {
            output
        }
    }
   ```
   The result is noticably different and matches the response a philosopher might give to the given question.

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    sam delete
    ```
