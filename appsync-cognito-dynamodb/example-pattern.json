This pattern is leveraging the native integration between AppSync and DynamoDB to map the request and response.",
			"With AppSync you can write a JavaScript function to contain your business logic. This function is contained within a pipeline resolver that associates the GraphQL schema with the datasource (DynamoDB in this case).",
			"At a high-level, this pattern deploys one AppSync API, a Cognito Userpool and Identity pool, and a DynamoDB table."
