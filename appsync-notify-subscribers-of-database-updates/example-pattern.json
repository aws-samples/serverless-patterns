      "The SAM template deploys a EventBridge, AppSync. We have described how to use Amazon EventBridge to simplify publishing out-of-band database updates to AppSync subscribers. By using EventBridge rules and input transformers, we created a GraphQL mutation payload that was sent to AppSync using an API destination without the need to write a Lambda function or specific code that would need to be maintained.",
      "With AppSync and EventBridge, you can seamlessly push data changes and events from your cloud backend all the way to thousands of connected front-end web and mobile clients with built-in WebSockets connection management leveraging flexible serverless technologies that scale automatically according to demand.(c)"
