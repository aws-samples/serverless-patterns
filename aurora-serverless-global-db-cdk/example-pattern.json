      "The pattern provisions an Amazon Aurora serverless v2 global database enabling data replication from the primary to secondary region. The regional primary cluster contains a serverless db instance and supports both writes and reads. The regional secondary cluster contains a serverless db instance and supports only reads. In the unlikely event of a regional degradation or outage, the secondary region can be promoted to read and write capabilities in less than 1 minute",
      "Also the pattern adopts the multiple stack capability of CDK to provision the resources across the primary and secondary regions."
