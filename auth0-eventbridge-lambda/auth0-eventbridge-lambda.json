            "This sample project demonstrates how to use the Auth0 Amazon EventBridge SaaS integration and AWS Lambda to process events from Auth0. This pattern is leveraging the Auth0 Amazon EventBridge SaaS integration to send login events from the customer's Auth0 account to their AWS account, via an Amazon EventBridge Partner event bus.",
            "Once the Auth0 events are in the customer's account, an Amazon EventBridge rule routes suspicious login events to a downstream Lambda function. In production cases, the Lambda function could transform the event, send it to a downstream application, archive it, or send a notification email to a customer using SES.",
            "Amazon CloudWatch Log Groups are provisioned for debugging and auditing.",
            "This pattern deploys two EventBridge rules, one Lambda function, and two CloudWatch Log Groups."
