      "This pattern demonstrates the Saga pattern using AWS Lambda durable functions to coordinate distributed transactions across multiple services.",
      "The orchestrator function executes a sequence of reservation steps (flight, hotel, car). Each step is checkpointed automatically using context.step().",
      "If any step fails, compensating transactions execute in reverse order to rollback all completed operations, ensuring data consistency.",
      "The durable function maintains execution state without requiring external storage like DynamoDB or Step Functions."
