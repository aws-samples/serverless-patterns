      "This CDK project demonstrates how to set up a queue based leveling pattern using AWS API Gateway REST API and SQS.",
      "Processing higher number of HTTP and webhook events synchronously during traffic peaks can cause performance deteroration." , 
      "To avoid these situations, a common architectural strategy is to use a queue that acts as a buffer for these synchronous requests.",
      "This CDK project deploys an API Gateway REST API that can act as a front door for requests and stores them in an Amazon SQS queue.",
      "Furthermore, if you want to to protect your API Gateway with a custom authorizer the project also has a stack to takes a Lambda ARN which implements authorization logic."
