      "In this pattern, AWS AppSync is configured with a a schema to manage and read todos. The pattern uses an event bridge bus and an EventBridge [API destination with OAuth authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-api-destinations.html) to trigger the AppSync GraphQL `updateTodo` mutation when an event that matches the defined rule is received. The AppSync [Lambda Authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#aws-lambda-authorization) is used to verify the provided OAuth token."
