      "In this pattern, AWS AppSync is configured with a a schema to manage and read todos. The pattern uses an event bridge bus and an EventBridge [API destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-api-destinations.html) to trigger the AppSync GraphQL `updateTodo` mutation when an event that matches the defined rule is received. The AppSync [API KEY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#api-key-authorization) is used as the mode of authorization."
