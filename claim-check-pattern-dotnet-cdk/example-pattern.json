      "This implements the claim check pattern by storing large payloads in DynamoDB and passing a reference key via EventBridge rule to an SQS queue. A Lambda function retrieves the payload from DynamoDB based on the key and passes it to a StepFunctions state machine for processing. The implementation leverages these AWS services for a serverless, event-driven architecture."
