# CloudFront to Lambda URL

This pattern demonstrates how to setup Amazon CloudFront to proxy and cache traffic to AWS Lambda Function URLs. 

A function URL is a dedicated endpoint for your Lambda function. When you create a function URL, Lambda automatically generates a unique URL endpoint for you. Unlike API Gateway endpoints, using this URL does not incur any additional charges, beyond the usual data transfer costs.

By configuring CloudFront in front of the Lambda Function URL endpoint you can use custom domain names, Cognito authentication via Lambda@Edge, AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield Advanced to protect your endpoint from attacks.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured with your account's credentials
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```bash
    cd cloudfront-lambda-url-cdk-ts/cdk
    ```
1. From the command line, install the Node.js dependencies, bootstrap CDK in your AWS account, and finally deploy the pattern:
    ```bash
    npm i
    npx cdk bootstrap
    npx cdk deploy
    ```

1. Note the outputs from the CDK deployment. The `CdkStack.CloudFrontDistributionURL` contains the URL of the cloudfront distribution that you can use to test the deployment.

## How it works

An Amazon CloudFront distribution is created that forwards requests to the domain name of the deployed AWS Lambda function URL. Amazon CloudFront also caches responses from the Lambda function. Note that the Lambda URL is public and can be used without the cloudfront distribution.

## Testing

Copy the url of the CloudFront distribution that you can find in the `cdk deploy` command output, called `CdkStack.CloudFrontDistributionURL`. Paste this URL in a browser and you will get a JSON response.

```bash
{"message":"Hello, world!"}
```

## Cleanup

Delete all deployed resources

```bash
npx cdk destroy
```
