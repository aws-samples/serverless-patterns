# Check S3 Object Tag Compliance Using CloudTrail, DynamoDB, and Lambda

This pattern shows how to leverage CloudTrail resource creation API calls to check for required S3 object tags and determine compliance. The resources used in this pattern include CloudTrail, S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB which are all deployed via CDK. From the CloudTrail logs stored in S3, PutObject events are populated into a DynamoDB table via Lambda. The items written into the table are then checked for the required tags to determine compliance.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) (AWS CDK) v2 installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd serverless-patterns/cloudtrail-lambda-dynamo-cdk/src
    ```
1. Run the following command to install the required project dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
1. The pattern checks for the existence of required S3 object keys:
     ```
    required_keys = {"Key1", "Key2", "Key3", "Key4"}
    ```
   If you wish to amend your required your required S3 object keys, open the Lambda function cloudtrail-lambda-dynamo-cdk/src/lib/lambda/object_tag_checker/index.py, and on line 17 replace the example keys with your required S3 object keys.
4. Use the following command to generate the AWS CloudFormation template for your CDK application:
    ```
    cdk synth
    ```
5. Use the following command to deploy the AWS resources for this pattern into your AWS account:
    ```
    cdk deploy
    ```
## Testing

Once the CDK stack has deployed successfully, you can take the following steps to ensure the pattern is working appropriately:

1.  Navigate to the CLoudFormation stack `TagComplianceStack` and retrieve the `AWS::S3::Bucket` resource name.
1. Using the AWS CLI, upload the `test_file.txt` found in the src folder to the S3 bucket name using the following command:
    ```
    aws s3 cp test/test_file.txt s3://<bucket-name>/test_file1.txt
    ```
    If the file upload was successful, you should receive the following response:
    ```
    upload test/test_file.txt to s3://<bucket-name>/test_file1.txt
    ```
    You can also open the AWS Management Console, navigate to S3, and confirm the uploaded file is found in the S3 bucket you specified.

1. Using the AWS CLI, upload and tag the `test_file.txt` found in the src folder to the S3 bucket using the following command:
   ```
   aws s3 cp test/test_file.txt s3://<bucket-name>/test_file2.txt
   aws s3api put-object-tagging \
       --bucket <bucket-name> \
       --key test_file2.txt \
       --tagging '{"TagSet": [{ "Key": "Key1", "Value": "key1_value" },{ "Key": "Key2", "Value": "key2_value" },{ "Key": "Key3", "Value": "key3_value" },{ "Key": "Key4", "Value": "key4_value" }]}'

   ```

1. In the DynamoDB console, navigate to DynamoDB, `s3-objects-table` table created for this pattern.

1. Select 'Explore table items'

1. Within a couple of minutes, you should see two new items populated into the DynamoDB table specifying the ARN of the uploaded objects. The `is_compliant` column should be set to `false` for `test_file1.txt` since the object was uploaded with no tags and set to `true` for `test_file2.txt`.

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```
    cdk destroy
    ```
