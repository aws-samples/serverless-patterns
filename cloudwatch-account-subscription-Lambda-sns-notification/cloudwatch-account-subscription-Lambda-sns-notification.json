            "This sample project showcases a centralized alerting system that leverages CloudWatch Logs Subscription filters and Lambda functions to trigger SNS notifications when a specified pattern is matched across any CloudWatch log group within the account. This robust solution enables comprehensive monitoring and proactive alerting, ensuring timely identification and mitigation of critical events or errors",
            "The core components of this pattern include a CloudWatch Logs Account-level Subscription filter, which monitors log events across the entire account, and a notification Lambda function. This function is triggered by the Subscription filter and responsibly publishes relevant details, such as log group name, log stream name, and the matched log event, to the SNS topic, ensuring that stakeholders receive comprehensive and actionable information."
