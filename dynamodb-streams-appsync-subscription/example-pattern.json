      "In some of your projects, you might want to be able to listen to changes made on your database that are not performed through client-side mutations.",
      "This sample project creates an AppSync API allowing you to listen to new items being created on a specific DynamoDB table through AWS AppSync subscriptions.",
      "With this pattern, a Lambda function will be invoked for every new item created on a DynamoDB table. It will in turn call an AppSync mutation with data source set as `None`. An AppSync subscription will be subscribed to that mutation allowing end users to be notified of a newly created DynamoDB item."
