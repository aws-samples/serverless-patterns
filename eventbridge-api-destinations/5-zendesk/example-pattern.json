            "This pattern creates an API Destination for the Zendesk Put Tickets API. Once deployed, the pattern allows a user to send events easily through Event Bridge to Zendesk to create tickets. The pattern creates the following resources: Event Bridge Bus, Event Bridge Connection, Event Bridge API Destination, Event Bridge Rule, IAM Role, and SQS Queue.",
            "The Event Bridge rule uses the API Destination and Connection as a target, SQS Queue as a DLQ, and the IAM role as its role. To send events go to the bus and send sample events. To create a ticket enter “MyTestMessage” for the detail type, “MyTestApp” for the source, the bus created by the pattern for the Event Bus Name, and any call that follows the format for the Zendesk PUT Tickets API as the detail (https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/tickets/tickets/#create-ticket).",
