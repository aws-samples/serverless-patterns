The pattern creates the following resources: EventBridge Bus, EventBridge Connection, EventBridge API Destination, EventBridge rule, IAM role, and SQS queue.",
            "The EventBridge rule uses the API Destination and Connection as a target, SQS queue as a DLQ, and the IAM role as its role. To send events go to the bus and send sample events. To send a log enter “MyDataDogApp” for the source, the bus created by the pattern for the Event Bus Name, and any call that follows the format for the sending logs as the detail (https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/#send-logs).",
