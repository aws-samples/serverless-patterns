The pattern creates the following resources: EventBridge Bus, EventBridge Connection, EventBridge API Destination, EventBridge rule, IAM role, and SQS queue.",

To send a log enter “MyDataDogApp” for the source, the bus created by the pattern for the Event Bus Name, and any call that follows the format for the sending logs as the detail (https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/#send-logs).",
