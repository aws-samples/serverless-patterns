Once deployed, the pattern allows a user to send events easily through EventBridge to create products in a Shopify store. The pattern creates the following resources: EventBridge Bus, EventBridge Connection, EventBridge API Destination, EventBridge Rule, IAM Role, and SQS Queue.",
            "The EventBridge rule uses the API Destination and Connection as a target, SQS Queue as a DLQ, and the IAM role as its role. To send events go to the bus and send sample events.",

            "Before using the pattern a Shopify app and Admin Key with the appropriate permissions should be created. (https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/admin-app-access-tokens#step-1-create-and-install-the-app).",
