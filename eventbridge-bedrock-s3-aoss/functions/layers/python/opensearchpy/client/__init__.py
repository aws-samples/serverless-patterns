class OpenSearch(Client):
    """
    OpenSearch client. Provides a straightforward mapping from
    Python to OpenSearch REST endpoints.

    The instance has attributes ``cat``, ``cluster``, ``indices``, ``ingest``,
    ``nodes``, ``snapshot`` and ``tasks`` that provide access to instances of
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.CatClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.ClusterClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.IndicesClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.IngestClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.NodesClient`,
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.SnapshotClient` and
    :class:`~opensearchpy.client.TasksClient` respectively. This is the
    preferred (and only supported) way to get access to those classes and their
    methods.

    You can specify your own connection class which should be used by providing
    the ``connection_class`` parameter::

        # create connection to localhost using the ThriftConnection
        client = OpenSearch(connection_class=ThriftConnection)

    If you want to turn on sniffing you have several options (described
    in :class:`~opensearchpy.Transport`)::

        # create connection that will automatically inspect the cluster to get
        # the list of active nodes. Start with nodes running on
        # 'opensearchnode1' and 'opensearchnode2'
        client = OpenSearch(
            ['opensearchnode1', 'opensearchnode2'],
            # sniff before doing anything
            sniff_on_start=True,
            # refresh nodes after a node fails to respond
            sniff_on_connection_fail=True,
            # and also every 60 seconds
            sniffer_timeout=60
        )

    Different hosts can have different parameters, use a dictionary per node to
    specify those::

        # connect to localhost directly and another node using SSL on port 443
        # and an url_prefix. Note that ``port`` needs to be an int.
        client = OpenSearch([
            {'host': 'localhost'},
            {'host': 'othernode', 'port': 443, 'url_prefix': 'opensearch', 'use_ssl': True},
        ])

    If using SSL, there are several parameters that control how we deal with
    certificates (see :class:`~opensearchpy.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        client = OpenSearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # make sure we verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=True,
            # provide a path to CA certs on disk
            ca_certs='/path/to/CA_certs'
        )

    If using SSL, but don't verify the certs, a warning message is showed
    optionally (see :class:`~opensearchpy.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        client = OpenSearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # no verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=False,
            # don't show warnings about ssl certs verification
            ssl_show_warn=False
        )

    SSL client authentication is supported
    (see :class:`~opensearchpy.Urllib3HttpConnection` for
    detailed description of the options)::

        client = OpenSearch(
            ['localhost:443', 'other_host:443'],
            # turn on SSL
            use_ssl=True,
            # make sure we verify SSL certificates
            verify_certs=True,
            # provide a path to CA certs on disk
            ca_certs='/path/to/CA_certs',
            # PEM formatted SSL client certificate
            client_cert='/path/to/clientcert.pem',
            # PEM formatted SSL client key
            client_key='/path/to/clientkey.pem'
        )

    Alternatively you can use RFC-1738 formatted URLs, as long as they are not
    in conflict with other options::

        client = OpenSearch(
            [
                'http://user:secret@localhost:9200/',
                'https://user:secret@other_host:443/production'
            ],
            verify_certs=True
        )

    By default, `JSONSerializer
    <https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/master/opensearch/serializer.py#L24>`_
    is used to encode all outgoing requests.
    However, you can implement your own custom serializer::

        from opensearchpy.serializer import JSONSerializer

        class SetEncoder(JSONSerializer):
            def default(self, obj):
                if isinstance(obj, set):
                    return list(obj)
                if isinstance(obj, Something):
                    return 'CustomSomethingRepresentation'
                return JSONSerializer.default(self, obj)

        client = OpenSearch(serializer=SetEncoder())

        Returns results matching a query.


        :arg body: The search definition using the Query DSL
        :arg index: Comma-separated list of data streams, indices, and
            aliases to search. Supports wildcards (`*`). To search all data streams
            and indices, omit this parameter or use `*` or `_all`.
        :arg _source: Indicates which source fields are returned for
            matching documents.These fields are returned in the `hits._source`
            property of the search response.Valid values are:`true` to return the
            entire document source;`false` to not return the document
            source;`<string>` to return the source fields that are specified as a
            comma-separated list (supports wildcard (`*`) patterns).
        :arg _source_excludes: A comma-separated list of source fields
            to exclude from the response.You can also use this parameter to exclude
            fields from the subset specified in `_source_includes` query
            parameter.If the `_source` parameter is `false`, this parameter is
            ignored.
        :arg _source_includes: A comma-separated list of source fields
            to include in the response.If this parameter is specified, only these
            source fields are returned.You can exclude fields from this subset using
            the `_source_excludes` query parameter.If the `_source` parameter is
            `false`, this parameter is ignored.
        :arg allow_no_indices: If `false`, the request returns an error
            if any wildcard expression, index alias, or `_all` value targets only
            missing or closed indices.This behavior applies even if the request
            targets other open indices.For example, a request targeting `foo*,bar*`
            returns an error if an index starts with `foo` but no index starts with
            `bar`.
        :arg allow_partial_search_results: If true, returns partial
            results if there are shard request timeouts or shard failures. If false,
            returns an error with no partial results. Default is True.
        :arg analyze_wildcard: If true, wildcard and prefix queries are
            analyzed.This parameter can only be used when the q query string
            parameter is specified. Default is false.
        :arg analyzer: Analyzer to use for the query string.This
            parameter can only be used when the q query string parameter is
            specified.
        :arg batched_reduce_size: The number of shard results that
            should be reduced at once on the coordinating node.This value should be
            used as a protection mechanism to reduce the memory overhead per search
            request if the potential number of shards in the request can be large.
            Default is 512.
        :arg ccs_minimize_roundtrips: If true, network round-trips
            between the coordinating node and the remote clusters are minimized when
            executing cross-cluster search (CCS) requests. Default is True.
        :arg default_operator: The default operator for query string
            query: AND or OR.This parameter can only be used when the `q` query
            string parameter is specified. Valid choices are and, or.
        :arg df: Field to use as default where no field prefix is given
            in the query string.This parameter can only be used when the q query
            string parameter is specified.
        :arg docvalue_fields: A comma-separated list of fields to return
            as the docvalue representation for each hit.
        :arg error_trace: Whether to include the stack trace of returned
            errors.
        :arg expand_wildcards: Type of index that wildcard patterns can
            match.If the request can target data streams, this argument determines
            whether wildcard expressions match hidden data streams.Supports comma-
            separated values, such as `open,hidden`. Valid choices are all, open,
            closed, hidden, none.
        :arg explain: If `true`, returns detailed information about
            score computation as part of a hit.
        :arg filter_path: Comma-separated list of filters used to reduce
            the response.
        :arg from_: Starting document offset.Needs to be non-negative.By
            default, you cannot page through more than 10,000 hits using the `from`
            and `size` parameters.To page through more hits, use the `search_after`
            parameter. Default is 0.
        :arg human: Whether to return human readable values for
            statistics.
        :arg ignore_throttled: If `true`, concrete, expanded or aliased
            indices will be ignored when frozen.
        :arg ignore_unavailable: If `false`, the request returns an
            error if it targets a missing or closed index.
        :arg include_named_queries_score: Indicates whether
            hit.matched_queries should be rendered as a map that includes the name
            of the matched query associated with its score (true) or as an array
            containing the name of the matched queries (false) Default is false.
        :arg lenient: If `true`, format-based query failures (such as
            providing text to a numeric field) in the query string will be
            ignored.This parameter can only be used when the `q` query string
            parameter is specified.
        :arg max_concurrent_shard_requests: Defines the number of
            concurrent shard requests per node this search executes
            concurrently.This value should be used to limit the impact of the search
            on the cluster in order to limit the number of concurrent shard
            requests. Default is 5.
        :arg pre_filter_shard_size: Defines a threshold that enforces a
            pre-filter roundtrip to prefilter search shards based on query rewriting
            if the number of shards the search request expands to exceeds the
            threshold.This filter roundtrip can limit the number of shards
            significantly if for instance a shard can not match any documents based
            on its rewrite method (if date filters are mandatory to match but the
            shard bounds and the query are disjoint).When unspecified, the pre-
            filter phase is executed if any of these conditions is met:the request
            targets more than 128 shards;the request targets one or more read-only
            index;the primary sort of the query targets an indexed field.
        :arg preference: Nodes and shards used for the search.By
            default, Opensearch selects from eligible nodes and shards using
            adaptive replica selection, accounting for allocation awareness. Valid
            values are:`_only_local` to run the search only on shards on the local
            node;`_local` to, if possible, run the search on shards on the local
            node, or if not, select shards using the default
            method;`_only_nodes:<node-id>,<node-id>` to run the search on only the
            specified nodes IDs, where, if suitable shards exist on more than one
            selected node, use shards on those nodes using the default method, or if
            none of the specified nodes are available, select shards from any
            available node using the default method;`_prefer_nodes:<node-id>,<node-
            id>` to if possible, run the search on the specified nodes IDs, or if
            not, select shards using the default method;`_shards:<shard>,<shard>` to
            run the search only on the specified shards;`<custom-string>` (any
            string that does not start with `_`) to route searches with the same
            `<custom-string>` to the same shards in the same order. Default is
            random.
        :arg pretty: Whether to pretty format the returned JSON
            response.
        :arg q: Query in the Lucene query string syntax using query
            parameter search.Query parameter searches do not support the full
            Opensearch Query DSL but are handy for testing.
        :arg request_cache: If `true`, the caching of search results is
            enabled for requests where `size` is `0`.Defaults to index level
            settings.
        :arg rest_total_hits_as_int: Indicates whether `hits.total`
            should be rendered as an integer or an object in the rest search
            response. Default is false.
        :arg routing: Custom value used to route operations to a
            specific shard.
        :arg scroll: Period to retain the search context for scrolling.
            See Scroll search results.By default, this value cannot exceed `1d` (24
            hours).You can change this limit using the `search.max_keep_alive`
            cluster-level setting.
        :arg search_pipeline: Customizable sequence of processing stages
            applied to search queries.
        :arg search_type: How distributed term frequencies are
            calculated for relevance scoring. Valid choices are query_then_fetch,
            dfs_query_then_fetch.
        :arg seq_no_primary_term: If `true`, returns sequence number and
            primary term of the last modification of each hit.
        :arg size: Defines the number of hits to return.By default, you
            cannot page through more than 10,000 hits using the `from` and `size`
            parameters.To page through more hits, use the `search_after` parameter.
            Default is 10.
        :arg sort: A comma-separated list of <field>:<direction> pairs.
        :arg source: The URL-encoded request definition. Useful for
            libraries that do not accept a request body for non-POST requests.
        :arg stats: Specific `tag` of the request for logging and
            statistical purposes.
        :arg stored_fields: A comma-separated list of stored fields to
            return as part of a hit.If no fields are specified, no stored fields are
            included in the response.If this field is specified, the `_source`
            parameter defaults to `false`.You can pass `_source: true` to return
            both source fields and stored fields in the search response.
        :arg suggest_field: Specifies which field to use for
            suggestions.
        :arg suggest_mode: Specifies the suggest mode.This parameter can
            only be used when the `suggest_field` and `suggest_text` query string
            parameters are specified. Valid choices are missing, popular, always.
        :arg suggest_size: Number of suggestions to return.This
            parameter can only be used when the `suggest_field` and `suggest_text`
            query string parameters are specified.
        :arg suggest_text: The source text for which the suggestions
            should be returned.This parameter can only be used when the
            `suggest_field` and `suggest_text` query string parameters are
            specified.
        :arg terminate_after: Maximum number of documents to collect for
            each shard.If a query reaches this limit, Opensearch terminates the
            query early.Opensearch collects documents before sorting.Use with
            caution.Opensearch applies this parameter to each shard handling the
            request.When possible, let Opensearch perform early termination
            automatically.Avoid specifying this parameter for requests that target
            data streams with backing indices across multiple data tiers.If set to
            `0` (default), the query does not terminate early.
        :arg timeout: Specifies the period of time to wait for a
            response from each shard.If no response is received before the timeout
            expires, the request fails and returns an error.
        :arg track_scores: If `true`, calculate and return document
            scores, even if the scores are not used for sorting.

            libraries that do not accept a request body for non-POST requests.
        :arg stats: Specific `tag` of the request for logging and
            statistical purposes.
        :arg terminate_after: Maximum number of documents to collect for
            each shard.If a query reaches this limit, Opensearch terminates the
            query early.Opensearch collects documents before sorting.Use with
            caution.Opensearch applies this parameter to each shard handling the
            request.When possible, let Opensearch perform early termination
            automatically.Avoid specifying this parameter for requests that target
            data streams with backing indices across multiple data tiers.
        :arg timeout: Period each update request waits for the following
            operations: dynamic mapping updates, waiting for active shards.
        :arg version: If `true`, returns the document version as part of
            a hit.
        :arg wait_for_active_shards: The number of shard copies that
            must be active before proceeding with the operation.Set to `all` or any
            positive integer up to the total number of shards in the index
            (`number_of_replicas+1`). Valid choices are all, index-setting.
        :arg wait_for_completion: If `true`, the request blocks until
            the operation is complete. Default is True.
