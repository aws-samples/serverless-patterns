This pattern demonstrates how to use AWS CodeBuild to run long-running scripts (scripts that run for more than 15 minutes) in a serverless application. This examples creates a CodeBuild project that runs a sample script triggered by a scheduled EventBridge rule, and a SNS topic to inform the completion of the CodeBuild project. A S3 bucket is also created to upload sample script."
