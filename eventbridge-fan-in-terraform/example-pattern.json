      "This pattern demonstrates how to aggregate all your events from multiple event busses (in the same region) to a central event bus in a different region.",
      "This pattern is deployed using Terraform to create a central EventBridge bus, EventBridge rules on fan-in buses and all IAM resources required.",
      "The event busses to aggregate can be defined in `terraform.tfvars` file (Sample ARNs are provided, replace with event bus ARNs as needed).",
      "The `provider.tf` file also lists the AWS Regions of the fan-in event bus and central event bus (replace these based on where your event busses exist and where you want your central bus to be created)."
