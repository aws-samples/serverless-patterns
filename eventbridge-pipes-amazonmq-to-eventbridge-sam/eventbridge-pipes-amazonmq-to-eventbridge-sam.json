          "Amazon MQ (ActiveMQ) queue is configured as a source for an Amazon EventBridge Pipe. The pipe consumes events placed on the queue and sends these to an Amazon EventBridge custom message bus. Amazon EventBridge Pipe performs a simple transformation of the event payload adding some meta data about the Pipe producing the event during processing. An Amazon EventBridge rule then processes any events produced by the Pipe to a CloudWatch Log Group configured to receive the events. The CloudWatch Log target on the Amazon EventBridge could be replaced with another target to build event-driven services with native AWS integrations reacting to events produced on a queue within an Amazon MQ."
