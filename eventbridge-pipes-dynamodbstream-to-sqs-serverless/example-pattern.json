      "This serverless pattern demonstrates how to send events from DynamoDB Stream to SQS using EventBridge Pipes. Whenever an item is inserted in DynamoDB table, the stream picks up the event & sends it to EventBridge Pipes. ",
      "EventBridge Pipes filters the event and passes to the next states accordingly. For this example pattern, it checks for INSERT events & passes it to enrichment Lambda function. The Lambda function makes some logs regarding to event & event name & finally passes it to the target SQS queue.",
      "The intermediate filter & enrichment Lambda functions are optional & can be skipped as part of editing the implementation."
