      "This terraform code deploys an EventBridge rule with target as SNS topic which has a Lambda function as subscription and the IAM permissions required to run the application. Whenever the EventBridge rule gets triggered, the Lambda function is invoked by the SNS topic. It also deploys the resources and the IAM permissions required to run the application.",
      "In this example, the EventBridge rule specified in `main.tf` filters the events based upon the criteria in the `aws_cloudwatch_event_rule` block. When matching events are sent to EventBridge that trigger the rule, they are delivered as a JSON event payload (see Example event payload from EventBridge to SNS in the README) to the SNS topic.",
      "SNS topic further invokes and delivers the message payload to subscribed  lambda function defined in `aws_lambda_function` block."
