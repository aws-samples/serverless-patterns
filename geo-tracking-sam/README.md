# App Location Tracking using AWS Location Services, Event Bridge, Lambda and DynamoDB

This pattern shows an example how AWS Location Trackers API for tracker movement can be invoked to trigger an event to send the trackers coordinates to a dynamoDB database deployed using SAM.  

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd serverless-patterns/geo-tracking-sam
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works

1. Lambda function receives a payload from your location services APP and sends location tracker update via the BatchUpdateDevicePosition API

2. Event Bridge rule listens for the Amazon Location Services API (BatchUpdateDevicePosition) being called via cloudtrail and invokes a lambda function

3. The Lambda function invokes an Amazon Location API (GetDevicePosition) with the tracker information to get the most recent position and updated the DynamoDB table with the location information.

## Testing

1. You can make a request to Lambda Function with the following payload. Modify the event.json as required:

```
sam local invoke --event events/event.json TrackerFunction

```
2. If the sample message is sent successfully, then you see the location updated on the dynamoDB table item.

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
