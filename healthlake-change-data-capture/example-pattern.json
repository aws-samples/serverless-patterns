            "When using this pattern, AWS HealthLake becomes not only a consumer of data but also a producer. By adding this capability to HealthLake, it can be put in the center of a modern distributed Healthcare application and serve as an ingress and egress point.  When changes occur in HealthLake, they are read, hydrated and then published onto an EventBridge Custom Bus.  Once on the Bus, many Rules can be added to extend to any number of consumers needed."
