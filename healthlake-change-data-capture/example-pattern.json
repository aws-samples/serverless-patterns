It comes with a robust API, many integrations to other AWS services and is purely hands-off (serverless).  By adding CDC capabilities it can also be used to extend data beyond it's storage.",

By adding this capability to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/golang-handler.html, it can be put in the center of a modern distributed Healthcare application and serve as an ingress and egress point."
