      "When a message is published to the IoT topic defined in the IoT Rule, this message will be delivered to the Kinesis Data Stream. The Lambda function is configured with an event source mapping and it will be triggered to process the streaming data. In this sample the Lambda function decodes the message polled from the Kinesis Data Stream and logs its content."
