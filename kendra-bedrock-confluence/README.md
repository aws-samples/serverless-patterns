# Amazon Kendra With Confluence to AWS Lambda to Amazon Bedrock

This pattern contains a sample stack that utilizes an AWS Lambda function to retrieve data from an Amazon Kendra index and then pass it to Amazon Bedrock to generate a response. The pattern includes usage of the Amazon Confluence data source connector. 

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the AWS Pricing page for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements
* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) (AWS CDK) installed
* [Request Amazon Bedrock Model Access for Anthropic Claude models on Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html)
* [Satisfy the prerequisites of the Confluence connector V2.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-v2-confluence.html), particularly the Confluence URL and storing your Confluence authentication credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret as both will be needed to deploy this stack.

## Deployment Instructions
1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd kendra-bedrock-confluence
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS CDK to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the app.py file:
    ```
    cdk deploy --parameters ConfluenceUrl=<YOUR_CONFLUENCE_URL> \
                --parameters ConfluenceSecretArn=<YOUR_CONFLUENCE_SECRET_ARN>
    ```

1. Note the outputs from the CDK deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

# How it works
Please refer to the architecture diagram below:

![End to End Architecture](images/architecture.png)

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**AWS Lambda:** Two AWS Lambda functions are created. `DataSourceSync` crawls and indexes the content. `InvokeBedrockLambda` invokes the specified model by passing the retrieved content from Amazon Kendra as context to the generative AI model.

**Amazon Kendra:** An Amazon Kendra index is created with a Confluence data source connector. When a the `InvokeBedrockLambda` function is called, documents are retrieved from the Amazon Kendra index.

**Amazon Bedrock:** Documents retrieved from the Amazon Kendra index are sent to Amazon Bedrock which responds with a generated response.

## Testing

CLI Lambda invoke with test event:

```bash
payload_base64=$(echo -n '{"question": "Value"}' | base64)

aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name INVOKE_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN \
  --payload "$payload_base64" \
  output.txt
```

The output.txt will contain the response generated by Amazon Bedrock.

Example JSON Lambda test event:

```
{
    "question": "Value"
}
```

## Cleanup

1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    cdk destroy
    ```
