			"The purpose of this pattern is to deploy the infrastructure to showcase on how handle the consumer(AWS Lambda) failure when reading the records from the Amazon Kinesis data stream.",
			"If the error handling measures fail, Lambda discards the records and continues processing batches from the stream. With the default settings, this means that a bad record can block processing on the affected shard for up to one week. To avoid this, in this project we are going to configure function's event source mapping with a reasonable number of retries and a maximum record age.",
            "To retain a record of discarded batches, we are going to configure a failed-event destination. Lambda sends the record to the destination - AWS SQS."
