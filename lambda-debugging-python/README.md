# Lambda Debugger for Python

The AWS SAM template deploys a Lambda function in Python with advanced debugging features including X-Ray and structured logging.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd lambda-debugging-python
    ```
3. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
4. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

5. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works

1. On line 16 insert your code as would any other Lambda function. If your code fails the exception block will be hit, provide structured logging to CloudWatch and continue to raise the exception so it creates a Lambda error metric.

## Testing

1. On line 16, assuming the variable ```x``` has not been assigned, add ```print(x)```

2. Invoke the function

3. View CloudWatch Logs and the format the error message is displayed

4. View CloudWatch Metrics and view that a Lambda error metric is displayed for your function

## Cleanup

1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
2. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query
    ```
