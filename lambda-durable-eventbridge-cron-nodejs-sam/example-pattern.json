    "text": [
      "This sample project demonstrates how to create a durable Lambda function that is triggered by EventBridge on a cron schedule. The Lambda function uses the AWS durable execution SDK to implement a multi-step workflow with automatic checkpointing and replay capabilities.",
      "The durable execution pattern allows Lambda functions to span multiple invocations while maintaining state. When the function calls context.wait(), it suspends execution and creates a checkpoint. A subsequent invocation resumes from the checkpoint without re-executing previous steps.",
      "This pattern deploys a durable Lambda function with Nodejs 24 runtime, an EventBridge rule with cron schedule, and uses function versioning to ensure the cron trigger targets a published version rather than $LATEST."
