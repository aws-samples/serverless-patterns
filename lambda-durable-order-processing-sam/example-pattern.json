    "text": [
      "This pattern demonstrates a production-ready order processing workflow with 17 steps using Lambda Durable Functions.",
      "The workflow includes validation, payment processing, fraud checks, credit checks (for high-value orders), inventory management, and shipping coordination.",
      "Durable execution enables long-running waits (5 minutes for warehouse processing, 3 minutes for carrier pickup) without consuming compute resources.",
      "Each step is automatically checkpointed, allowing the workflow to survive interruptions and resume from the last successful step.",
      "The pattern uses a dual-function architecture: async durable function for order processing and sync non-durable function for real-time status queries.",
      "Order state is persisted in DynamoDB with real-time status updates throughout the 17-step workflow."
