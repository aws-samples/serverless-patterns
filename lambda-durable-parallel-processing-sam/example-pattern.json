    "text": [
      "This pattern demonstrates parallel processing using Lambda durable functions to execute multiple independent operations concurrently.",
      "The workflow validates orders by running four worker functions in parallel: inventory check, payment validation, shipping calculation, and tax calculation.",
      "Parallel execution reduces total processing time from ~575ms (sequential) to ~200ms (parallel), achieving a 2.9x speedup.",
      "Each parallel task is automatically checkpointed, allowing the workflow to survive interruptions and resume from the last successful step.",
      "The pattern uses a five-function architecture: one durable orchestrator and four non-durable worker functions.",
      "All validation results are aggregated and validated before calculating final order totals and confirming the order."
