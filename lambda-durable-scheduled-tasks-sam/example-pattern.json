      "This pattern implements a multi-day scheduled task orchestration using AWS Lambda Durable Functions. The workflow spans 7 days with automatic checkpointing, demonstrating how to build long-running workflows with scheduled intervals and zero compute cost during wait periods.",
      "The solution uses a streamlined architecture: a durable function handles the 7-day orchestration with automatic checkpointing, while a unified task management function provides listing, status queries, and deletion operations via API Gateway.",
      "Day 1 collects initial data from multiple sources. Days 2-6 process daily batches with 24-hour waits between each day. Day 7 generates a comprehensive report, sends notifications, and performs cleanup. Each step is automatically checkpointed for resilience.",
      "The pattern includes a web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring of all tasks with progress tracking, statistics, and management capabilities.",
      "The pattern demonstrates significant cost savings: traditional polling would require 10,080 Lambda invocations over 7 days, while durable functions need only ~10 invocations with $0 cost during wait states - a 99.9% cost reduction."
