      "This pattern demonstrates a serverless webhook receiver using AWS Lambda Durable Functions with Python.",

      "Each processing step is automatically checkpointed, allowing the workflow to resume from the last successful step if interrupted.",
      "Webhook events and processing state are persisted in DynamoDB with automatic TTL cleanup after 7 days."
