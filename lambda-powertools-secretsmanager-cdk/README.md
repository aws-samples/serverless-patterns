# AWS Lambda with PowerTools and SecretsManager Integration

This pattern creates an AWS Lambda function to call a protected API endpoint. It is integrated with AWS SecretsManager via Lambda PowerTools, and is deployed with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) in Python. It includes a test API Gateway deployment to aid in both demonstration and testing. The sample application was developed in Python.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS CDK Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cli.html) installed and configured
* [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns

    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd serverless-patterns/lambda-powertools-secretsmanager-cdk/src
    ```
1. Create a virtual environment for Python:
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
1. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    For a Windows platform, activate the virtualenv like this:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
1. Install the Python required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS CDK to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the app.py file:
    ```
    cdk synth
    cdk deploy --all
    ```
1. Note the outputs from the CDK deployment process. This will contain the deployed Lambda function URL.

## How it works

The deployed Lambda function uses [Lambda Powertools](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/2.5.0/) to query AWS SecretsManager for an API key. This API key is then used to invoke an API endpoint using [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

## Testing

Paste the Lambda function URL that is generated by CDK Deploy into your web browser. This endpoint is public for testing and verification purposes only. Make sure to secure/remove the endpoint if using in production systems.

## Cleanup

1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    cdk destroy --all
    ```
