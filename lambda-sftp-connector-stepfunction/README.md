# SFTP Server to Amazon S3

This pattern shows how to use AWS Transfer Family SFTP connector to transfer files from SFTP server to Amazon S3. EventBridge is used to schedule periodic execution of the Step functions. The Step functions orchastrates the workflow.  It invokes a Lambda function to retrieve the list of files created or updated after the previous execution of the workflow, followed by another Lambda function which creates file transfer jobs in SFTP connector. SFTP Connector transfers these files from source SFTP server to S3. The status of each transfer job is pushed to DynamoDB using EventBridge and Lambda function. Retry mechanism for failed files is implemented using Lambda.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
1. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd lambda-sftp-connector-stepfunction
    ```
1. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    sam deploy --guided
    ```
1. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works

Explain how the service interaction works.

## Testing

Go to EventBridge schedule and check the configured time of Step functions execution. You may manually execute the Step functions. Once the execution is complete, check S3 buckets. All files present in the source SFTP server are transferred to given S3 bucket.

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
1. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
