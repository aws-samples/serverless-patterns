    "text": [
      "Signing AWS Lambda function code helps ensure function images are valid and unmodified.",
      "However, this is an extra step in the deployment process that may dissuade developers from using it.",
      "This pattern simplifies this process by providing an AWS Step Functions workflow that automates this process.",
      "This pattern creates two stacks, an infrastructure stack providing a pipeline for function signing and deployment, and the function stack itself.",
      "The infrastructure stack will create CI/CD resources using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline.",
      "However, other CI/CD tools may be substituted in, provided they integrate with AWS Step Functions.",
      "Developers can extend the deployment workflow by adding other actions to the AWS Step Functions state machine or AWS CodePipeline pipeline.",
      "Additionally, as stated before, if different CI/CD tools are preferred, they can be substituted into the infrastructure template."
