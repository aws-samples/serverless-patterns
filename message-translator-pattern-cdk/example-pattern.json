      "This example uses SQS as source and Step Functions as target, but the pattern can be applied to other sources and targets as well.",
      "In an event-driven architecture, event senders and receivers are independent from each other, and for that reason, the events they exchange may have different formats. To allow communication between different components, a translation of these events is needed, known as the Message Translator pattern. For example, an event contains an address, but the consumer expects coordinates."
