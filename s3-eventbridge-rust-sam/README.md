# Amazon S3 to Amazon EventBridge

The SAM template deploys an S3 bucket that publishes events to Amazon EventBridge, and sets up a Lambda function to show how to consume these events via an EventBridge rule. It deploys the the IAM resources required to run the application.

EventBridge consumes events directly from S3 buckets when the NoticationConfiguration is enabled, as shown in the template. Learn more about this setting in the documentation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-event-notifications-eventbridge.html.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 1.56.0 or higher
* [cargo-zigbuild](https://github.com/messense/cargo-zigbuild) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) for cross-compilation

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ```
    cd s3-eventbridge-rust-sam
    ```
3. Install dependencies and build:
    ```
    make build
    ```
4. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yml file:
    ```
    make deploy
    ```
5. During the prompts:
    * Enter a stack name
    * Enter the desired AWS Region
    * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.

    Once you have run `sam deploy --guided` mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaults.

6. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.

## How it works

* Upload an object to the deployed S3 bucket.
* The Lambda function is invoked with the event from S3, routed via EventBridge.

## Example payload

The event delivered to the EventBridge rule target (a Lambda function in this example) has the following structure:

```
    {
        "version": "0",
        "id": "5d1069c2-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
        "detail-type": "Object Created",
        "source": "aws.s3",
        "account": "123456789012",
        "time": "2021-12-10T12:55:54Z",
        "region": "us-east-1",
        "resources": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::eb-s3-test-sourcebucket-123456789012"
        ],
        "detail": {
            "version": "0",
            "bucket": {
                "name": "eb-s3-test-sourcebucket-123456789012"
            },
            "object": {
                "key": "small-test-file.txt",
                "size": 2726,
                "etag": "123456789012123456789012123456789012",
                "sequencer": "123456789012"
            },
            "request-id": "123456789012",
            "requester": "123456789012",
            "source-ip-address": "123.123.123.123",
            "reason": "PutObject"
        }
    }
```

## Testing

1. Run the following S3 CLI command to upload an object to the S3 bucket. Note, you must edit the *SourceBucketName* placeholder with the name of the S3 Bucket. This is provided in the stack outputs.

```bash
aws s3 cp './events/example.jpg'  s3://*SourceBucketName*
```

2. Run the following command to check to get the logs from the deployed Lambda function (use the function name from the stack output):

```bash
sam logs -n *FunctionName* --region *YourRegion*
```

## Cleanup

1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name STACK_NAME
    ```
2. Confirm the stack has been deleted
    ```bash
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
