# Load data from JSON files in Amazon S3 into Amazon DynamoDB using S3 Event Notification and AWS Lambda

This pattern in [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) offers a complete solution to load data from JSON files uploaded to S3. The following resources are created:
1. S3 Bucket with event notification on object created
2. DynamoDB Table with on-demand billing mode
3. Lambda function that runs python with an environment variable containing the dynamodb table name 

## Requirements

* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) version 1.x (this pattern has been tested with version 1.9.8)

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory its source code folder:
    ```bash
    cd s3-lambda-dynamodb-terraform/
    ```
3. From the command line, use Terraform to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the main.tf file::
    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply --auto-approve
    ```
4. Note the outputs from the Terraform deployment process. These contain the resource names which are used for testing.

## Testing

### Initiate the data load process
1. Once deployment has completed, locate the S3 Bucket Name and DynamoDB table name in the output, for example:
    ``` bash
    module.s3_event.aws_s3_bucket.json_bucket: Creation complete after 2s [id=s3-lambda-dynamodb-terraform-json-store]

    module.dynamodb.aws_dynamodb_table.basic-dynamodb-table: Creation complete after 7s [id=dev-test]
    ```

2. A sample JSON file is provided in the `samples` folder. You can upload it using AWS CLI:
    ``` bash
    aws s3 cp ./samples/test.json s3://s3-lambda-dynamodb-terraform-json-store
    ```

    > **Important**: When uploading your own JSON files, ensure they contain the following mandatory field:
    > - `UserId`: Unique identifier for the record

    Example JSON format:
    ```json
    {
        "UserId": "user123",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john@example.com"
    }
    ```

3. Verify the data in DynamoDB:
    ```bash
    aws dynamodb scan --table-name dev-test
    ```

## Cleanup
 
1. Delete the stack
    ```bash
    terraform destroy --auto-approve
    ```
2. Confirm the removal and wait for the resource deletion to complete.
