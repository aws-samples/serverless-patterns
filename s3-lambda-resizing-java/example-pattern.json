      "This sample project shows how to use a Java-based Lambda function to resize an image from a source S3 bucket and put the resized image in a destination S3 bucket.",
      "When a new JPEG image is added to the source S3 bucket, an event gets triggered which invoks the Java-based Lambda function. The Lambda functions gets the object from the bucket, resizes it to 800x600 resolution, and puts the resized image in the destination bucket.",
      "This pattern uses AWS SAM with Lambda SnapStart on ARM64 architecture on a Java 21 manged runtime."
