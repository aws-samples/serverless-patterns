		<h2 id="S3Features">Features of Amazon S3</h2>
		 
			<h3 id="RRS">Storage classes</h3>
			<p>Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. For
				example, you can store mission-critical production data in S3 Standard or S3 Express One Zone for frequent
				access, save costs by storing infrequently accessed data in S3 Standard-IA or
				S3 One Zone-IA, and archive data at the lowest costs in S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval,
				S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. </p>
			<p>Amazon S3 Express One Zone is a high-performance, single-zone Amazon S3 storage class that is purpose-built
				to deliver consistent, single-digit millisecond data access for your most
				latency-sensitive applications. S3 Express One Zone is the lowest latency cloud object
				storage class available today, with data access
				speeds
				up to 10x faster and with request costs
				50
				percent lower than S3 Standard. S3 Express One Zone is the first S3 storage class where you can select a single Availability Zone with 
the option to co-locate your object storage with your compute resources, which provides the highest possible access speed.
				Additionally, to further increase access speed and support hundreds of thousands of
				requests per second, data is stored in a new bucket type: an
				Amazon S3 directory bucket. For more information, see <a href="./s3-express-one-zone.html">What is S3 Express One Zone?</a> and <a href="./directory-buckets-overview.html">Directory
            buckets</a>.</p>
			<p>You can store data with changing or unknown access patterns in
				S3 Intelligent-Tiering, which optimizes storage costs by automatically moving your
				data between four access tiers when your access patterns change. These four access
				tiers include two low-latency access tiers optimized for frequent and infrequent
				access, and two opt-in archive access tiers designed for asynchronous access for
				rarely accessed data.</p>
			<p>For more information, see <a href="./storage-class-intro.html">Using Amazon S3 storage classes</a>. For more information about
				S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/introduction.html"><em>Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide</em></a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="features-storage-management">Storage management</h3>

				are strongly consistent. For more information, see <a href="#ConsistencyModel">Amazon S3 data consistency model</a>.</p>
		 
	 
		<h2 id="CoreConcepts">How Amazon S3 works</h2>
		<p>Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An
				<em>object</em> is a file and any metadata that describes
			the file. A <em>bucket</em> is a container for objects. </p>
		<p>To store your data in Amazon S3, you first create a bucket and specify a bucket name and
			AWS Region. Then, you upload your data to that bucket as objects in Amazon S3. Each object
			has a <em>key</em> (or <em>key
				name</em>), which is the unique identifier for the object within the
			bucket.</p>
		<p>S3 provides features that you can configure to support your specific use case. For
			example, you can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in the same
			bucket, which allows you to restore objects that are accidentally deleted or
			overwritten.</p>
		<p>Buckets and the objects in them are private and can be accessed only if you explicitly
			grant access permissions. You can use bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies,
			access control lists (ACLs), and S3 Access Points to manage access.</p>
		<div class="highlights" id="inline-topiclist"><h6>Topics</h6><ul><li><a href="#BasicsBucket">Buckets</a></li><li><a href="#BasicsObjects">Objects</a></li><li><a href="#BasicsKeys">Keys</a></li><li><a href="#Versions">S3 Versioning</a></li><li><a href="#BasicsVersionID">Version ID</a></li><li><a href="#BucketPolicies">Bucket policy</a></li><li><a href="#BasicsAccessPoints">S3 Access Points</a></li><li><a href="#S3_ACLs">Access control lists (ACLs)</a></li><li><a href="#Regions">Regions</a></li></ul></div>
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsBucket">Buckets</h3>
			<p>A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. You can store any number of
				objects in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account. To request an
				increase, visit the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/s3/quotas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Service Quotas
				console</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
			<p>Every object is contained in a bucket. For example, if the object named
					<code class="code">photos/puppy.jpg</code> is stored in the
					<code class="code">DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET</code> bucket in the US West (Oregon)
				Region, then it is addressable by using the URL
					<code class="code">https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg</code>.
				For more information, see <a href="./access-bucket-intro.html">Accessing a
					Bucket</a>. </p>
			<p>When you create a bucket, you enter a bucket name and choose the AWS Region
				where the bucket will reside. After you create a bucket, you cannot change the name
				of the bucket or its Region. Bucket names must follow the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html">bucket naming rules</a>. You can also configure a bucket to use <a href="./Versioning.html">S3 Versioning</a> or other <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/managing-storage.html">storage management</a>
				features.</p>

			<h3 id="BasicsObjects">Objects</h3>
			<p>Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object
				data and metadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the
				object. These pairs include some default metadata, such as the date last modified,
				and standard HTTP metadata, such as <code class="code">Content-Type</code>. You can also specify
				custom metadata at the time that the object is stored.</p>
			<p>An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a <a href="#BasicsKeys">key (name)</a> and a <a href="#BasicsVersionID">version ID</a> (if
				S3 Versioning is enabled on the bucket). For more information about objects, see
					<a href="./UsingObjects.html">Amazon S3 objects overview</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsKeys">Keys</h3>
			<p>An <em>object key</em> (or <em>key
					name</em>) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every
				object in a bucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, object key, and
				optionally, version ID (if S3 Versioning is enabled for the bucket) uniquely identify
				each object. So you can think of Amazon S3 as a basic data map between "bucket + key +
				version" and the object itself. </p>
			<p>Every object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service
				endpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL
					<code class="code">https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg</code>,
					<code>DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET</code> is the name of the bucket
				and <code>photos/puppy.jpg</code> is the key.</p>
			<p>For more information about object keys, see <a href="./object-keys.html">Creating object key names</a>. </p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="Versions">S3 Versioning</h3>
			<p>You can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same
				bucket. With S3 Versioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of
				every object stored in your buckets. You can easily recover from both unintended
				user actions and application failures.</p>
			<p>For more information, see <a href="./Versioning.html">Using versioning in S3 buckets</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsVersionID">Version ID</h3>
			<p>When you enable S3 Versioning in a bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for
				each object added to the bucket. Objects that already existed in the bucket at the
				time that you enable versioning have a version ID of <code class="code">null</code>. If you
				modify these (or any other) objects with other operations, such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html">CopyObject</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html">PutObject</a>, the new objects
				get a unique version ID.</p>
			<p>For more information, see <a href="./Versioning.html">Using versioning in S3 buckets</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BucketPolicies">Bucket policy</h3>
			<p>A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you can use to
				grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner
				can associate a policy with a bucket. The permissions attached to the bucket apply
				to all of the objects in the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner. Bucket
				policies are limited to 20 KB in size.</p>
			<p>Bucket policies use JSON-based access policy language that is standard across
				AWS. You can use bucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a
				bucket. Bucket policies allow or deny requests based on the elements in the policy,
				including the requester, S3 actions, resources, and aspects or conditions of the
				request (for example, the IP address used to make the request). For example, you can
				create a bucket policy that grants cross-account permissions to upload objects to an
				S3 bucket while ensuring that the bucket owner has full control of the uploaded
				objects. For more information, see <a href="./example-bucket-policies.html">Bucket policy examples</a>.</p>
			<p>In your bucket policy, you can use wildcard characters on Amazon Resource Names
				(ARNs) and other values to grant permissions to a subset of objects. For example,
				you can control access to groups of objects that begin with a common <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#keyprefix">prefix</a> or end with a given extension, such as
				<code class="code">.html</code>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="BasicsAccessPoints">S3 Access Points</h3>
			<p>Amazon S3 Access Points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that
				describe how data can be accessed using that endpoint. Access Points are attached to
				buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as GetObject and
				PutObject. Access Points simplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets
				in Amazon S3. </p>
			<p>Each access point has its own access point policy. You can configure <a href="./access-control-block-public-access.html">Block Public Access</a> settings
				for each access point. To restrict Amazon S3 data access to a private network, you can
				also configure any access point to accept requests only from a virtual private cloud
				(VPC).</p>
			<p>For more information, see <a href="./access-points.html">Managing data access with Amazon S3 access points</a>. </p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="S3_ACLs">Access control lists (ACLs)</h3>
			<p>You can use ACLs to grant read and write permissions to authorized users for
				individual buckets and objects. Each bucket and object has an ACL attached to it as
				a subresource. The ACL defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and
				the type of access. ACLs are an access control mechanism that predates IAM. For
				more information about ACLs, see <a href="./acl-overview.html">Access control list (ACL) overview</a>.</p>
			<p>S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to both control ownership of the objects that are 
    uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs. By default, Object Ownership is set to the Bucket owner enforced setting, 
    and all ACLs are disabled. When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to them 
    exclusively by using access-management policies.</p>
	<p> A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs. We recommend that you keep ACLs disabled, except 
	in unusual circumstances where you need to control access for each object individually. With ACLs disabled, you can use policies 
	to control access to all objects in your bucket, regardless of who uploaded the objects to your bucket. 
	For more information, see <a href="./about-object-ownership.html">Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs
			for your bucket</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="Regions">Regions</h3>
			<p>You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 stores the buckets that
				you create. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or
				address regulatory requirements. Objects stored in an AWS Region never leave the
				Region unless you explicitly transfer or replicate them to another Region. <span>For example, objects stored in the Europe (Ireland) Region
					never leave it.</span>
			</p>
			<div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>You can access Amazon S3 and its features only in the AWS Regions that are
					enabled for your account. For more information about enabling a Region to create
					and manage AWS resources, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS Regions</a> in

		<h2 id="ConsistencyModel">Amazon S3 data consistency model</h2>
		<p>Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUT and DELETE requests of
			objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions. This behavior applies to both writes
			to new objects as well as PUT requests that overwrite existing objects and DELETE
			requests. In addition, read operations on Amazon S3 Select, Amazon S3 access controls lists
			(ACLs), Amazon S3 Object Tags, and object metadata (for example, the HEAD object) are
			strongly consistent. </p>
		<p>Updates to a single key are atomic. For example, if you make a PUT request to an
			existing key from one thread and perform a GET request on the same key from a second
			thread concurrently, you will get either the old data or the new data, but never partial
			or corrupt data.</p>


		<p>Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers within
			AWS data centers. If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely stored. Any read
			(GET or LIST request) that is initiated following the receipt of a successful PUT
			response will return the data written by the PUT request. Here are examples of this
			behavior: </p>
		<div class="itemizedlist">
			 
			 
			 
			 
		<ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">

				</li><li class="listitem">

					amount of time for the change to be fully propagated. We recommend that you wait

			</li></ul></div>

		 
			<h3 id="ApplicationConcurrency">Concurrent applications</h3>
			<p>This section provides examples of behavior to be expected from Amazon S3 when multiple
				clients are writing to the same items.</p>
			<p>In this example, both W1 (write 1) and W2 (write 2) finish before the start of R1
				(read 1) and R2 (read 2). Because S3 is strongly consistent, R1 and R2 both return
					<code class="code">color = ruby</code>. </p>
			<div class="mediaobject">
				 
					<img src="/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/consistency1.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding aws-docs-img-filter" />
				 
			</div>
			<p>In the next example, W2 does not finish before the start of R1. Therefore, R1
				might return <code class="code">color = ruby</code> or <code class="code">color = garnet</code>. However,
				because W1 and W2 finish before the start of R2, R2 returns <code class="code">color =
					garnet</code>. </p>
			<div class="mediaobject">
				 
					<img src="/images/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/consistency2.png" class="aws-docs-img-whiteBg aws-docs-img-padding aws-docs-img-filter" />
				 
			</div>
			<p>In the last example, W2 begins before W1 has received an acknowledgment.
				Therefore, these writes are considered concurrent. Amazon S3 internally uses
				last-writer-wins semantics to determine which write takes precedence. However, the
				order in which Amazon S3 receives the requests and the order in which applications
				receive acknowledgments cannot be predicted because of various factors, such as
				network latency. For example, W2 might be initiated by an Amazon EC2 instance in the same
				Region, while W1 might be initiated by a host that is farther away. The best way to
				determine the final value is to perform a read after both writes have been
				acknowledged. </p>

		<h2 id="API">Accessing Amazon S3</h2>
		<p>You can work with Amazon S3 in any of the following ways:</p>
		 
			<h3 id="access-aws-management-console">AWS Management Console</h3>
			<p>The console is a web-based user interface for managing Amazon S3 and AWS resources.
				If you've signed up for an AWS account, you can access the Amazon S3 console by signing
				into the AWS Management Console and choosing <b>S3</b> from the AWS Management Console home
				page.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="access-aws-cli">AWS Command Line Interface</h3>
			<p>You can use the AWS command line tools to issue commands or build scripts at
				your system's command line to perform AWS (including S3) tasks.</p>
			<p>The <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cli/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> provides commands
				for a broad set of AWS services. The AWS CLI is supported on Windows, macOS, and
				Linux. To get started, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/"><em>AWS Command Line Interface User Guide</em></a>. For more information about the commands for
				Amazon S3, see <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>s3api</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> and <a href="https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3control/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>s3control</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a> in the <em>AWS CLI Command Reference</em>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="access-aws-sdks">AWS SDKs</h3>
			<p>AWS provides SDKs (software development kits) that consist of libraries and sample code
				for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, iOS,
				Android, and so on). The AWS SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
				access to S3 and AWS. Amazon S3 is a REST service. You can send requests to Amazon S3 using
				the AWS SDK libraries, which wrap the underlying Amazon S3 REST API and simplify your
				programming tasks. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as calculating
				signatures, cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying
				requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to
				download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Tools for
					AWS</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
			<p>Every interaction with Amazon S3 is either authenticated or anonymous. If you are using
				the AWS SDKs, the libraries compute the signature for authentication from the keys
				that you provide. For more information about how to make requests to Amazon S3, see <a href="./MakingRequests.html">Making requests</a>.</p>
		 
		 
			<h3 id="UsingRESTAPI">Amazon S3 REST API</h3>
			<p>The architecture of Amazon S3 is designed to be programming language-neutral, using
				AWS-supported interfaces to store and retrieve objects. You can access S3 and
				AWS programmatically by using the Amazon S3 REST API. The REST API is an HTTP interface
				to Amazon S3. With the REST API, you use standard HTTP requests to create, fetch, and
				delete buckets and objects.</p>
			<p>To use the REST API, you can use any toolkit that supports HTTP. You can even use
				a browser to fetch objects, as long as they are anonymously readable.</p>
			<p>The REST API uses standard HTTP headers and status codes, so that standard
				browsers and toolkits work as expected. In some areas, we have added functionality
				to HTTP (for example, we added headers to support access control). In these cases,
				we have done our best to add the new functionality in a way that matches the style
				of standard HTTP usage.</p>
			<p>If you make direct REST API calls in your application, you must write the code to
				compute the signature and add it to the request. For more information about how to
				make requests to Amazon S3, see <a href="./MakingRequests.html">Making requests</a>.</p>
			<div class="awsdocs-note"><div class="awsdocs-note-title"><awsui-icon name="status-info" variant="link"></awsui-icon><h6>Note</h6></div><div class="awsdocs-note-text"><p>SOAP API support over HTTP is deprecated, but it is still available over

		<h2 id="PayingforStorage">Paying for Amazon S3</h2>
		<p>Pricing for Amazon S3 is designed so that you don't have to plan for the storage
			requirements of your application. Most storage providers require you to purchase a
			predetermined amount of storage and network transfer capacity. In this scenario, if you
			exceed that capacity, your service is shut off or you are charged high overage fees. If
			you do not exceed that capacity, you pay as though you used it all. </p>
		<p>Amazon S3 charges you only for what you actually use, with no hidden fees and no overage
			charges. This model gives you a variable-cost service that can grow with your business
			while giving you the cost advantages of the AWS infrastructure. For more information,
			see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>Amazon S3 Pricing</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>.</p>
		<p>When you sign up for AWS, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all
			services in AWS, including Amazon S3. However, you are charged only for the services that
			you use. If you are a new Amazon S3 customer, you can get started with Amazon S3 for free. For
			more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>AWS free tier</span><awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external"></awsui-icon></a>. </p>
