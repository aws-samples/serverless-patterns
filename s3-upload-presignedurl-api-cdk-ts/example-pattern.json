A good and now common practice is to upload them directly to Amazon S3, using [pre-signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html). To generate this pre-signed URL, you have to use the AWS SDK (generally in an AWS Lambda function), and expose the feature to the client through an API (with Amazon API Gateway).",
