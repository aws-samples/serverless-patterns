      "This pattern builds an intelligent AWS Health event monitoring system that automatically captures health events, analyzes them using AI, and sends enhanced notifications.",
      "When AWS Health events occur, EventBridge automatically captures them based on the configured rule pattern. The Lambda function processes these events and leverages Amazon Bedrock's Claude 3 Haiku model to generate intelligent summaries, impact assessments, and actionable recommendations. The enhanced analysis is then formatted and sent via SNS email notifications.",
      "The AI analysis provides three key insights: a brief summary of the health event, potential impact on your AWS services, and specific recommended actions to take. This transforms basic health notifications into actionable intelligence, helping teams respond more effectively to AWS service issues."
