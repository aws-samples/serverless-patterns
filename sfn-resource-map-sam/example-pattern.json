      "Once the template creates all the resources, the state machine that was created is used to orchestrate the process of mapping all the state machines present in that particular region. The state machine invokes the two lambda functions in a specific order which are responsible for placing the necessary API calls to fetch the list of all the state machines present along with a list of its integrated AWS services.",
"Currently, this workflow/pattern maps the state machines present in a region and also gives the details of errors and throttles for the past 7 days, but it can be further modified to extend the duration."
