# AWS Lambda Construct Library

This construct library allows you to define AWS Lambda Functions.

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)
```

## Handler Code

The `lambda.Code` class includes static convenience methods for various types of
runtime code.

* `lambda.Code.fromBucket(bucket, key[, objectVersion])` - specify an S3 object
  that contains the archive of your runtime code.
* `lambda.Code.fromInline(code)` - inline the handle code as a string. This is
  limited to supported runtimes.
* `lambda.Code.fromAsset(path)` - specify a directory or a .zip file in the local
  filesystem which will be zipped and uploaded to S3 before deployment. See also
  [bundling asset code](#bundling-asset-code).
* `lambda.Code.fromDockerBuild(path, options)` - use the result of a Docker
  build as code. The runtime code is expected to be located at `/asset` in the
  image and will be zipped and uploaded to S3 as an asset.
* `lambda.Code.fromCustomCommand(output, command, customCommandOptions)` -
  supply a command that is invoked during cdk synth. That command is meant to direct
  the generated code to output (a zip file or a directory), which is then used as the
  code for the created AWS Lambda.

The following example shows how to define a Python function and deploy the code
from the local directory `my-lambda-handler` to it:

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "MyLambda",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "my-lambda-handler")),
    handler="index.main",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9
)
```

When deploying a stack that contains this code, the directory will be zip
archived and then uploaded to an S3 bucket, then the exact location of the S3
objects will be passed when the stack is deployed.

During synthesis, the CDK expects to find a directory on disk at the asset
directory specified. Note that we are referencing the asset directory relatively
to our CDK project directory. This is especially important when we want to share
this construct through a library. Different programming languages will have
different techniques for bundling resources into libraries.

## Docker Images

Lambda functions allow specifying their handlers within docker images. The docker
image can be an image from ECR or a local asset that the CDK will package and load
into ECR.

The following `DockerImageFunction` construct uses a local folder with a
Dockerfile as the asset that will be used as the function handler.

```python
lambda_.DockerImageFunction(self, "AssetFunction",
    code=lambda_.DockerImageCode.from_image_asset(path.join(__dirname, "docker-handler"))
)
```

You can also specify an image that already exists in ECR as the function handler.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_ecr as ecr

repo = ecr.Repository(self, "Repository")

lambda_.DockerImageFunction(self, "ECRFunction",
    code=lambda_.DockerImageCode.from_ecr(repo)
)
```

The props for these docker image resources allow overriding the image's `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, and `WORKDIR`
configurations as well as choosing a specific tag or digest. See their docs for more information.

To deploy a `DockerImageFunction` on Lambda `arm64` architecture, specify `Architecture.ARM_64` in `architecture`.
This will bundle docker image assets for `arm64` architecture with `--platform linux/arm64` even if build within an `x86_64` host.

```python
lambda_.DockerImageFunction(self, "AssetFunction",
    code=lambda_.DockerImageCode.from_image_asset(path.join(__dirname, "docker-arm64-handler")),
    architecture=lambda_.Architecture.ARM_64
)
```

## Execution Role

Lambda functions assume an IAM role during execution. In CDK by default, Lambda
functions will use an autogenerated Role if one is not provided.

The autogenerated Role is automatically given permissions to execute the Lambda
function. To reference the autogenerated Role:

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)

role = fn.role
```

You can also provide your own IAM role. Provided IAM roles will not automatically
be given permissions to execute the Lambda function. To provide a role and grant
it appropriate permissions:

```python
my_role = iam.Role(self, "My Role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("lambda.amazonaws.com")
)

fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    role=my_role
)

my_role.add_managed_policy(iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"))
my_role.add_managed_policy(iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole"))
```

## Function Timeout

AWS Lambda functions have a default timeout of 3 seconds, but this can be increased
up to 15 minutes. The timeout is available as a property of `Function` so that
you can reference it elsewhere in your stack. For instance, you could use it to create
a CloudWatch alarm to report when your function timed out:

```python
import aws_cdk as cdk
import aws_cdk.aws_cloudwatch as cloudwatch


fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    timeout=Duration.minutes(5)
)

if fn.timeout:
    cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "MyAlarm",
        metric=fn.metric_duration().with(
            statistic="Maximum"
        ),
        evaluation_periods=1,
        datapoints_to_alarm=1,
        threshold=fn.timeout.to_milliseconds(),
        treat_missing_data=cloudwatch.TreatMissingData.IGNORE,
        alarm_name="My Lambda Timeout"
    )
```

## Advanced Logging

You can have more control over your function logs, by specifying the log format
(Json or plain text), the system log level, the application log level, as well
as choosing the log group:

```python
from aws_cdk.aws_logs import ILogGroup

# log_group: ILogGroup


lambda_.Function(self, "Lambda",
    code=lambda_.InlineCode("foo"),
    handler="index.handler",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    logging_format=lambda_.LoggingFormat.JSON,
    system_log_level_v2=lambda_.SystemLogLevel.INFO,
    application_log_level_v2=lambda_.ApplicationLogLevel.INFO,
    log_group=log_group
)
```

To use `applicationLogLevelV2` and/or `systemLogLevelV2` you must set `loggingFormat` to `LoggingFormat.JSON`.

## Resource-based Policies

AWS Lambda supports resource-based policies for controlling access to Lambda
functions and layers on a per-resource basis. In particular, this allows you to
give permission to AWS services, AWS Organizations, or other AWS accounts to
modify and invoke your functions.

### Grant function access to AWS services

```python
# Grant permissions to a service
# fn: lambda.Function

principal = iam.ServicePrincipal("my-service")

fn.grant_invoke(principal)

# Equivalent to:
fn.add_permission("my-service Invocation",
    principal=principal
)
```

You can also restrict permissions given to AWS services by providing
a source account or ARN (representing the account and identifier of the resource
that accesses the function or layer).

For more information, see
[Granting function access to AWS services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html#permissions-resource-serviceinvoke)
in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.

### Grant function access to an AWS Organization

```python
# Grant permissions to an entire AWS organization
# fn: lambda.Function

org = iam.OrganizationPrincipal("o-xxxxxxxxxx")

fn.grant_invoke(org)
```

In the above example, the `principal` will be `*` and all users in the
organization `o-xxxxxxxxxx` will get function invocation permissions.

You can restrict permissions given to the organization by specifying an
AWS account or role as the `principal`:

```python
# Grant permission to an account ONLY IF they are part of the organization
# fn: lambda.Function

account = iam.AccountPrincipal("123456789012")

fn.grant_invoke(account.in_organization("o-xxxxxxxxxx"))
```

For more information, see
[Granting function access to an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html#permissions-resource-xorginvoke)
in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.

### Grant function access to other AWS accounts

```python
# Grant permission to other AWS account
# fn: lambda.Function

account = iam.AccountPrincipal("123456789012")

fn.grant_invoke(account)
```

For more information, see
[Granting function access to other accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html#permissions-resource-xaccountinvoke)
in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide.

### Grant function access to unowned principals

Providing an unowned principal (such as account principals, generic ARN
principals, service principals, and principals in other accounts) to a call to
`fn.grantInvoke` will result in a resource-based policy being created. If the
principal in question has conditions limiting the source account or ARN of the
operation (see above), these conditions will be automatically added to the
resource policy.

```python
# fn: lambda.Function

service_principal = iam.ServicePrincipal("my-service")
source_arn = "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
source_account = "111122223333"
service_principal_with_conditions = service_principal.with_conditions({
    "ArnLike": {
        "aws:SourceArn": source_arn
    },
    "StringEquals": {
        "aws:SourceAccount": source_account
    }
})

fn.grant_invoke(service_principal_with_conditions)
```

### Grant function access to a CompositePrincipal

To grant invoke permissions to a `CompositePrincipal` use the `grantInvokeCompositePrincipal` method:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function

composite_principal = iam.CompositePrincipal(
    iam.OrganizationPrincipal("o-zzzzzzzzzz"),
    iam.ServicePrincipal("apigateway.amazonaws.com"))

fn.grant_invoke_composite_principal(composite_principal)
```

## Versions

You can use
[versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html)
to manage the deployment of your AWS Lambda functions. For example, you can
publish a new version of a function for beta testing without affecting users of
the stable production version.

The function version includes the following information:

* The function code and all associated dependencies.
* The Lambda runtime that executes the function.
* All of the function settings, including the environment variables.
* A unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to identify this version of the function.

You could create a version to your lambda function using the `Version` construct.

```python
# fn: lambda.Function

version = lambda_.Version(self, "MyVersion",
    lambda_=fn
)
```

The major caveat to know here is that a function version must always point to a
specific 'version' of the function. When the function is modified, the version
will continue to point to the 'then version' of the function.

One way to ensure that the `lambda.Version` always points to the latest version
of your `lambda.Function` is to set an environment variable which changes at
least as often as your code does. This makes sure the function always has the
latest code. For instance -

```python
code_version = "stringOrMethodToGetCodeVersion"
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    environment={
        "CodeVersionString": code_version
    }
)
```

The `fn.latestVersion` property returns a `lambda.IVersion` which represents
the `$LATEST` pseudo-version.

However, most AWS services require a specific AWS Lambda version,
and won't allow you to use `$LATEST`. Therefore, you would normally want
to use `lambda.currentVersion`.

The `fn.currentVersion` property can be used to obtain a `lambda.Version`
resource that represents the AWS Lambda function defined in your application.
Any change to your function's code or configuration will result in the creation
of a new version resource. You can specify options for this version through the
`currentVersionOptions` property.

NOTE: The `currentVersion` property is only supported when your AWS Lambda function
uses either `lambda.Code.fromAsset` or `lambda.Code.fromInline`. Other types
of code providers (such as `lambda.Code.fromBucket`) require that you define a
`lambda.Version` resource directly since the CDK is unable to determine if
their contents had changed.

### `currentVersion`: Updated hashing logic

To produce a new lambda version each time the lambda function is modified, the
`currentVersion` property under the hood, computes a new logical id based on the
properties of the function. This informs CloudFormation that a new
`AWS::Lambda::Version` resource should be created pointing to the updated Lambda
function.

However, a bug was introduced in this calculation that caused the logical id to
change when it was not required (ex: when the Function's `Tags` property, or
when the `DependsOn` clause was modified). This caused the deployment to fail
since the Lambda service does not allow creating duplicate versions.

This has been fixed in the AWS CDK but *existing* users need to opt-in via a
[feature flag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/featureflags.html). Users who have run `cdk init` since this fix will be opted in,
by default.

Otherwise, you will need to enable the [feature flag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/featureflags.html)
`@aws-cdk/aws-lambda:recognizeVersionProps`. Since CloudFormation does not
allow duplicate versions, you will also need to make some modification to
your function so that a new version can be created. To efficiently and trivially
modify all your lambda functions at once, you can attach the
`FunctionVersionUpgrade` aspect to the stack, which slightly alters the
function description. This aspect is intended for one-time use to upgrade the
version of all your functions at the same time, and can safely be removed after
deploying once.

```python
stack = Stack()
Aspects.of(stack).add(lambda_.FunctionVersionUpgrade(LAMBDA_RECOGNIZE_VERSION_PROPS))
```

When the new logic is in effect, you may rarely come across the following error:
`The following properties are not recognized as version properties`. This will
occur, typically when [property overrides](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/cfn_layer.html#cfn_layer_raw) are used, when a new property
introduced in `AWS::Lambda::Function` is used that CDK is still unaware of.

To overcome this error, use the API `Function.classifyVersionProperty()` to
record whether a new version should be generated when this property is changed.
This can be typically determined by checking whether the property can be
modified using the *[UpdateFunctionConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_UpdateFunctionConfiguration.html)* API or not.

### `currentVersion`: Updated hashing logic for layer versions

An additional update to the hashing logic fixes two issues surrounding layers.
Prior to this change, updating the lambda layer version would have no effect on
the function version. Also, the order of lambda layers provided to the function
was unnecessarily baked into the hash.

This has been fixed in the AWS CDK starting with version 2.27. If you ran
`cdk init` with an earlier version, you will need to opt-in via a [feature flag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/featureflags.html).
If you run `cdk init` with v2.27 or later, this fix will be opted in, by default.

Existing users will need to enable the [feature flag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/featureflags.html)
`@aws-cdk/aws-lambda:recognizeLayerVersion`. Since CloudFormation does not
allow duplicate versions, they will also need to make some modification to
their function so that a new version can be created. To efficiently and trivially
modify all your lambda functions at once, users can attach the
`FunctionVersionUpgrade` aspect to the stack, which slightly alters the
function description. This aspect is intended for one-time use to upgrade the
version of all your functions at the same time, and can safely be removed after
deploying once.

```python
stack = Stack()
Aspects.of(stack).add(lambda_.FunctionVersionUpgrade(LAMBDA_RECOGNIZE_LAYER_VERSION))
```

## Aliases

You can define one or more
[aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html)
for your AWS Lambda function. A Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific
Lambda function version. Users can access the function version using the alias
ARN.

The `version.addAlias()` method can be used to define an AWS Lambda alias that
points to a specific version.

The following example defines an alias named `live` which will always point to a
version that represents the function as defined in your CDK app. When you change
your lambda code or configuration, a new resource will be created. You can
specify options for the current version through the `currentVersionOptions`
property.

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    current_version_options=lambda.VersionOptions(
        removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.RETAIN,  # retain old versions
        retry_attempts=1
    ),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)

fn.add_alias("live")
```

## Function URL

A function URL is a dedicated HTTP(S) endpoint for your Lambda function. When you create a function URL, Lambda automatically generates a unique URL endpoint for you. Function URLs can be created for the latest version Lambda Functions, or Function Aliases (but not for Versions).

Function URLs are dual stack-enabled, supporting IPv4 and IPv6, and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration. After you configure a function URL for your function, you can invoke your function through its HTTP(S) endpoint via a web browser, curl, Postman, or any HTTP client. To invoke a function using IAM authentication your HTTP client must support SigV4 signing.

See the [Invoking Function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-invocation.html) section of the AWS Lambda Developer Guide
for more information on the input and output payloads of Functions invoked in this way.

### IAM-authenticated Function URLs

To create a Function URL which can be called by an IAM identity, call `addFunctionUrl()`, followed by `grantInvokeFunctionUrl()`:

```python
# Can be a Function or an Alias
# fn: lambda.Function
# my_role: iam.Role


fn_url = fn.add_function_url()
fn_url.grant_invoke_url(my_role)

CfnOutput(self, "TheUrl",
    # The .url attributes will return the unique Function URL
    value=fn_url.url
)
```

Calls to this URL need to be signed with SigV4.

### Anonymous Function URLs

To create a Function URL which can be called anonymously, pass `authType: FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE` to `addFunctionUrl()`:

```python
# Can be a Function or an Alias
# fn: lambda.Function


fn_url = fn.add_function_url(
    auth_type=lambda_.FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE
)

CfnOutput(self, "TheUrl",
    value=fn_url.url
)
```

### CORS configuration for Function URLs

If you want your Function URLs to be invokable from a web page in browser, you
will need to configure cross-origin resource sharing to allow the call (if you do
not do this, your browser will refuse to make the call):

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


fn.add_function_url(
    auth_type=lambda_.FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE,
    cors=lambda.FunctionUrlCorsOptions(
        # Allow this to be called from websites on https://example.com.
        # Can also be ['*'] to allow all domain.
        allowed_origins=["https://example.com"]
    )
)
```

### Invoke Mode for Function URLs

Invoke mode determines how AWS Lambda invokes your function. You can configure the invoke mode when creating a Function URL using the invokeMode property

```python
# fn: lambda.Function


fn.add_function_url(
    auth_type=lambda_.FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE,
    invoke_mode=lambda_.InvokeMode.RESPONSE_STREAM
)
```

If the invokeMode property is not specified, the default BUFFERED mode will be used.

## Layers

The `lambda.LayerVersion` class can be used to define Lambda layers and manage
granting permissions to other AWS accounts or organizations.

```python
layer = lambda_.LayerVersion(stack, "MyLayer",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "layer-code")),
    compatible_runtimes=[lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST],
    license="Apache-2.0",
    description="A layer to test the L2 construct"
)

# To grant usage by other AWS accounts
layer.add_permission("remote-account-grant", account_id=aws_account_id)

# To grant usage to all accounts in some AWS Ogranization
# layer.grantUsage({ accountId: '*', organizationId });

lambda_.Function(stack, "MyLayeredLambda",
    code=lambda_.InlineCode("foo"),
    handler="index.handler",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
    layers=[layer]
)
```

By default, updating a layer creates a new layer version, and CloudFormation will delete the old version as part of the stack update.

Alternatively, a removal policy can be used to retain the old version:

```python
lambda_.LayerVersion(self, "MyLayer",
    removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.RETAIN,
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)
```

## Architecture

Lambda functions, by default, run on compute systems that have the 64 bit x86 architecture.

The AWS Lambda service also runs compute on the ARM architecture, which can reduce cost
for some workloads.

A lambda function can be configured to be run on one of these platforms:

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    architecture=lambda_.Architecture.ARM_64
)
```

Similarly, lambda layer versions can also be tagged with architectures it is compatible with.

```python
lambda_.LayerVersion(self, "MyLayer",
    removal_policy=RemovalPolicy.RETAIN,
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    compatible_architectures=[lambda_.Architecture.X86_64, lambda_.Architecture.ARM_64]
)
```

## Lambda Insights

Lambda functions can be configured to use CloudWatch [Lambda Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Lambda-Insights.html)
which provides low-level runtime metrics for a Lambda functions.

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    insights_version=lambda_.LambdaInsightsVersion.VERSION_1_0_98_0
)
```

If the version of insights is not yet available in the CDK, you can also provide the ARN directly as so -

```python
layer_arn = "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:580247275435:layer:LambdaInsightsExtension:14"
lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    insights_version=lambda_.LambdaInsightsVersion.from_insight_version_arn(layer_arn)
)
```

If you are deploying an ARM_64 Lambda Function, you must specify a
Lambda Insights Version >= `1_0_119_0`.

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    architecture=lambda_.Architecture.ARM_64,
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    insights_version=lambda_.LambdaInsightsVersion.VERSION_1_0_119_0
)
```

### Parameters and Secrets Extension

Lambda functions can be configured to use the Parameters and Secrets Extension. The Parameters and Secrets Extension can be used to retrieve and cache [secrets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets_lambda.html) from Secrets Manager or [parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ps-integration-lambda-extensions.html) from Parameter Store in Lambda functions without using an SDK.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_secretsmanager as sm
import aws_cdk.aws_ssm as ssm


secret = sm.Secret(self, "Secret")
parameter = ssm.StringParameter(self, "Parameter",
    parameter_name="mySsmParameterName",
    string_value="mySsmParameterValue"
)

params_and_secrets = lambda_.ParamsAndSecretsLayerVersion.from_version(lambda_.ParamsAndSecretsVersions.V1_0_103,
    cache_size=500,
    log_level=lambda_.ParamsAndSecretsLogLevel.DEBUG
)

lambda_function = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    architecture=lambda_.Architecture.ARM_64,
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    params_and_secrets=params_and_secrets
)

secret.grant_read(lambda_function)
parameter.grant_read(lambda_function)
```

If the version of Parameters and Secrets Extension is not yet available in the CDK, you can also provide the ARN directly as so:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_secretsmanager as sm
import aws_cdk.aws_ssm as ssm


secret = sm.Secret(self, "Secret")
parameter = ssm.StringParameter(self, "Parameter",
    parameter_name="mySsmParameterName",
    string_value="mySsmParameterValue"
)

layer_arn = "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:177933569100:layer:AWS-Parameters-and-Secrets-Lambda-Extension:4"
params_and_secrets = lambda_.ParamsAndSecretsLayerVersion.from_version_arn(layer_arn,
    cache_size=500
)

lambda_function = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    architecture=lambda_.Architecture.ARM_64,
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    params_and_secrets=params_and_secrets
)

secret.grant_read(lambda_function)
parameter.grant_read(lambda_function)
```

## Event Rule Target

You can use an AWS Lambda function as a target for an Amazon CloudWatch event
rule:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_events as events
import aws_cdk.aws_events_targets as targets

# fn: lambda.Function

rule = events.Rule(self, "Schedule Rule",
    schedule=events.Schedule.cron(minute="0", hour="4")
)
rule.add_target(targets.LambdaFunction(fn))
```

## Event Sources

AWS Lambda supports a [variety of event sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invoking-lambda-function.html).

In most cases, it is possible to trigger a function as a result of an event by
using one of the `add<Event>Notification` methods on the source construct. For
example, the `s3.Bucket` construct has an `onEvent` method which can be used to
trigger a Lambda when an event, such as PutObject occurs on an S3 bucket.

An alternative way to add event sources to a function is to use `function.addEventSource(source)`.
This method accepts an `IEventSource` object. The module **@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-event-sources**
includes classes for the various event sources supported by AWS Lambda.

For example, the following code adds an SQS queue as an event source for a function:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda_event_sources as eventsources
import aws_cdk.aws_sqs as sqs

# fn: lambda.Function

queue = sqs.Queue(self, "Queue")
fn.add_event_source(eventsources.SqsEventSource(queue))
```

The following code adds an S3 bucket notification as an event source:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda_event_sources as eventsources
import aws_cdk.aws_s3 as s3

# fn: lambda.Function

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket")
fn.add_event_source(eventsources.S3EventSource(bucket,
    events=[s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED, s3.EventType.OBJECT_REMOVED],
    filters=[s3.NotificationKeyFilter(prefix="subdir/")]
))
```

The following code adds an DynamoDB notification as an event source filtering insert events:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_lambda_event_sources as eventsources
import aws_cdk.aws_dynamodb as dynamodb

# fn: lambda.Function

table = dynamodb.Table(self, "Table",
    partition_key=dynamodb.Attribute(
        name="id",
        type=dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING
    ),
    stream=dynamodb.StreamViewType.NEW_IMAGE
)
fn.add_event_source(eventsources.DynamoEventSource(table,
    starting_position=lambda_.StartingPosition.LATEST,
    filters=[lambda_.FilterCriteria.filter({"event_name": lambda_.FilterRule.is_equal("INSERT")})]
))
```

See the documentation for the **@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-event-sources** module for more details.

## Imported Lambdas

When referencing an imported lambda in the CDK, use `fromFunctionArn()` for most use cases:

```python
fn = lambda_.Function.from_function_arn(self, "Function", "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:MyFn")
```

The `fromFunctionAttributes()` API is available for more specific use cases:

```python
fn = lambda_.Function.from_function_attributes(self, "Function",
    function_arn="arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:MyFn",
    # The following are optional properties for specific use cases and should be used with caution:

    # Use Case: imported function is in the same account as the stack. This tells the CDK that it
    # can modify the function's permissions.
    same_environment=True,

    # Use Case: imported function is in a different account and user commits to ensuring that the
    # imported function has the correct permissions outside the CDK.
    skip_permissions=True
)
```

`Function.fromFunctionArn()` and `Function.fromFunctionAttributes()` will attempt to parse the Function's Region and Account ID from the ARN. `addPermissions` will only work on the `Function` object if the Region and Account ID are deterministically the same as the scope of the Stack the referenced `Function` object is created in.
If the containing Stack is environment-agnostic or the Function ARN is a Token, this comparison will fail, and calls to `Function.addPermission` will do nothing.
If you know Function permissions can safely be added, you can use `Function.fromFunctionName()` instead, or pass `sameEnvironment: true` to `Function.fromFunctionAttributes()`.

```python
fn = lambda_.Function.from_function_name(self, "Function", "MyFn")
```

## Lambda with DLQ

A dead-letter queue can be automatically created for a Lambda function by
setting the `deadLetterQueueEnabled: true` configuration. In such case CDK creates
a `sqs.Queue` as `deadLetterQueue`.

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("exports.handler = function(event, ctx, cb) { return cb(null, \"hi\"); }"),
    dead_letter_queue_enabled=True
)
```

It is also possible to provide a dead-letter queue instead of getting a new queue created:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_sqs as sqs


dlq = sqs.Queue(self, "DLQ")
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("exports.handler = function(event, ctx, cb) { return cb(null, \"hi\"); }"),
    dead_letter_queue=dlq
)
```

You can also use a `sns.Topic` instead of an `sqs.Queue` as dead-letter queue:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_sns as sns


dlt = sns.Topic(self, "DLQ")
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("// your code here"),
    dead_letter_topic=dlt
)
```

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/dlq.html)
to learn more about AWS Lambdas and DLQs.

## Lambda with X-Ray Tracing

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("exports.handler = function(event, ctx, cb) { return cb(null, \"hi\"); }"),
    tracing=lambda_.Tracing.ACTIVE
)
```

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html)
to learn more about AWS Lambda's X-Ray support.

## Lambda with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry layer

To have automatic integration with XRay without having to add dependencies or change your code, you can use the
[AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda (ADOT) layer](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda).
Consuming the latest ADOT layer can be done with the following snippet:

```python
from aws_cdk.aws_lambda import AdotLambdaExecWrapper, AdotLayerVersion, AdotLambdaLayerJavaScriptSdkVersion


fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("exports.handler = function(event, ctx, cb) { return cb(null, \"hi\"); }"),
    adot_instrumentation=lambda.AdotInstrumentationConfig(
        layer_version=AdotLayerVersion.from_java_script_sdk_layer_version(AdotLambdaLayerJavaScriptSdkVersion.LATEST),
        exec_wrapper=AdotLambdaExecWrapper.REGULAR_HANDLER
    )
)
```

To use a different layer version, use one of the following helper functions for the `layerVersion` prop:

* `AdotLayerVersion.fromJavaScriptSdkLayerVersion`
* `AdotLayerVersion.fromPythonSdkLayerVersion`
* `AdotLayerVersion.fromJavaSdkLayerVersion`
* `AdotLayerVersion.fromJavaAutoInstrumentationSdkLayerVersion`
* `AdotLayerVersion.fromGenericSdkLayerVersion`

Each helper function expects a version value from a corresponding enum-like class as below:

* `AdotLambdaLayerJavaScriptSdkVersion`
* `AdotLambdaLayerPythonSdkVersion`
* `AdotLambdaLayerJavaSdkVersion`
* `AdotLambdaLayerJavaAutoInstrumentationSdkVersion`
* `AdotLambdaLayerGenericSdkVersion`

For more examples, see our [the integration test](test/integ.lambda-adot.ts).

If you want to retrieve the ARN of the ADOT Lambda layer without enabling ADOT in a Lambda function:

```python
# fn: lambda.Function

layer_arn = lambda_.AdotLambdaLayerJavaSdkVersion.V1_19_0.layer_arn(fn.stack, fn.architecture)
```

When using the `AdotLambdaLayerPythonSdkVersion` the `AdotLambdaExecWrapper` needs to be `AdotLambdaExecWrapper.INSTRUMENT_HANDLER` as per [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Lambda Support For Python](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda/lambda-python)

## Lambda with Profiling

The following code configures the lambda function with CodeGuru profiling. By default, this creates a new CodeGuru
profiling group -

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset("lambda-handler"),
    profiling=True
)
```

The `profilingGroup` property can be used to configure an existing CodeGuru profiler group.

CodeGuru profiling is supported for all Java runtimes and Python3.6+ runtimes.

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-ug/setting-up-lambda.html)
to learn more about AWS Lambda's Profiling support.

## Lambda with Reserved Concurrent Executions

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_inline("exports.handler = function(event, ctx, cb) { return cb(null, \"hi\"); }"),
    reserved_concurrent_executions=100
)
```

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html)
managing concurrency.

## Lambda with SnapStart

SnapStart is currently supported only on Java 11/Java 17 runtime. SnapStart does not support provisioned concurrency, the arm64 architecture, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), or ephemeral storage greater than 512 MB. After you enable Lambda SnapStart for a particular Lambda function, publishing a new version of the function will trigger an optimization process.

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html) to learn more about AWS Lambda SnapStart

```python
fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "handler.zip")),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.JAVA_11,
    handler="example.Handler::handleRequest",
    snap_start=lambda_.SnapStartConf.ON_PUBLISHED_VERSIONS
)

version = fn.current_version
```

## AutoScaling

You can use Application AutoScaling to automatically configure the provisioned concurrency for your functions. AutoScaling can be set to track utilization or be based on a schedule. To configure AutoScaling on a function alias:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_autoscaling as autoscaling

# fn: lambda.Function

alias = fn.add_alias("prod")

# Create AutoScaling target
as = alias.add_auto_scaling(max_capacity=50)

# Configure Target Tracking
as.scale_on_utilization(
    utilization_target=0.5
)

# Configure Scheduled Scaling
as.scale_on_schedule("ScaleUpInTheMorning",
    schedule=autoscaling.Schedule.cron(hour="8", minute="0"),
    min_capacity=20
)
```

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_applicationautoscaling as appscaling
import aws_cdk as cdk
from ......cx_api import LAMBDA_RECOGNIZE_LAYER_VERSION
import aws_cdk as lambda_

#
# Stack verification steps:
# aws application-autoscaling describe-scalable-targets --service-namespace lambda --resource-ids function:<function name>:prod
# has a minCapacity of 3 and maxCapacity of 50
#
class TestStack(cdk.Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope, id):
        super().__init__(scope, id)

        fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyLambda",
            code=lambda_.InlineCode("exports.handler = async () => { console.log('hello world'); };"),
            handler="index.handler",
            runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST
        )

        version = fn.current_version

        alias = lambda_.Alias(self, "Alias",
            alias_name="prod",
            version=version
        )

        scaling_target = alias.add_auto_scaling(min_capacity=3, max_capacity=50)

        scaling_target.scale_on_utilization(
            utilization_target=0.5
        )

        scaling_target.scale_on_schedule("ScaleUpInTheMorning",
            schedule=appscaling.Schedule.cron(hour="8", minute="0"),
            min_capacity=20
        )

        scaling_target.scale_on_schedule("ScaleDownAtNight",
            schedule=appscaling.Schedule.cron(hour="20", minute="0"),
            max_capacity=20
        )

        cdk.CfnOutput(self, "FunctionName",
            value=fn.function_name
        )

app = cdk.App()

stack = TestStack(app, "aws-lambda-autoscaling")

# Changes the function description when the feature flag is present
# to validate the changed function hash.
cdk.Aspects.of(stack).add(lambda_.FunctionVersionUpgrade(LAMBDA_RECOGNIZE_LAYER_VERSION))

app.synth()
```

See [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-scaling.html) on autoscaling lambda functions.

## Log Group

By default, Lambda functions automatically create a log group with the name `/aws/lambda/<function-name>` upon first execution with
log data set to never expire.
This is convenient, but prevents you from changing any of the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK.
For example you cannot set log retention or assign a data protection policy.

To fully customize the logging behavior of your Lambda function, create a `logs.LogGroup` ahead of time and use the `logGroup` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it.
This way you can use the full features set supported by Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

```python
from aws_cdk.aws_logs import LogGroup


my_log_group = LogGroup(self, "MyLogGroupWithLogGroupName",
    log_group_name="customLogGroup"
)

lambda_.Function(self, "Lambda",
    code=lambda_.InlineCode("foo"),
    handler="index.handler",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    log_group=my_log_group
)
```

Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16.
If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first.

### Legacy Log Retention

As an alternative to providing a custom, user controlled log group, the legacy `logRetention` property can be used to set a different expiration period.
This feature uses a Custom Resource to change the log retention of the automatically created log group.

By default, CDK uses the AWS SDK retry options when creating a log group. The `logRetentionRetryOptions` property
allows you to customize the maximum number of retries and base backoff duration.

*Note* that a [CloudFormation custom
resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cfn-customresource.html) is added
to the stack that pre-creates the log group as part of the stack deployment, if it already doesn't exist, and sets the
correct log retention period (never expire, by default). This Custom Resource will also create a log group to log events of the custom resource. The log retention period for this addtional log group is hard-coded to 1 day.

*Further note* that, if the log group already exists and the `logRetention` is not set, the custom resource will reset
the log retention to never expire even if it was configured with a different value.

## FileSystem Access

You can configure a function to mount an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to a
directory in your runtime environment with the `filesystem` property. To access Amazon EFS
from lambda function, the Amazon EFS access point will be required.

The following sample allows the lambda function to mount the Amazon EFS access point to `/mnt/msg` in the runtime environment and access the filesystem with the POSIX identity defined in `posixUser`.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_ec2 as ec2
import aws_cdk.aws_efs as efs


# create a new VPC
vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "VPC")

# create a new Amazon EFS filesystem
file_system = efs.FileSystem(self, "Efs", vpc=vpc)

# create a new access point from the filesystem
access_point = file_system.add_access_point("AccessPoint",
    # set /export/lambda as the root of the access point
    path="/export/lambda",
    # as /export/lambda does not exist in a new efs filesystem, the efs will create the directory with the following createAcl
    create_acl=efs.Acl(
        owner_uid="1001",
        owner_gid="1001",
        permissions="750"
    ),
    # enforce the POSIX identity so lambda function will access with this identity
    posix_user=efs.PosixUser(
        uid="1001",
        gid="1001"
    )
)

fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyLambda",
    # mount the access point to /mnt/msg in the lambda runtime environment
    filesystem=lambda_.FileSystem.from_efs_access_point(access_point, "/mnt/msg"),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    vpc=vpc
)
```

## IPv6 support

You can configure IPv6 connectivity for lambda function by setting `Ipv6AllowedForDualStack` to true.
It allows Lambda functions to specify whether the IPv6 traffic should be allowed when using dual-stack VPCs.
To access IPv6 network using Lambda, Dual-stack VPC is required. Using dual-stack VPC a function communicates with subnet over either of IPv4 or IPv6.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_ec2 as ec2


nat_provider = ec2.NatProvider.gateway()

# create dual-stack VPC
vpc = ec2.Vpc(self, "DualStackVpc",
    ip_protocol=ec2.IpProtocol.DUAL_STACK,
    subnet_configuration=[ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
        name="Ipv6Public1",
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC
    ), ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
        name="Ipv6Public2",
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC
    ), ec2.SubnetConfiguration(
        name="Ipv6Private1",
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
    )
    ],
    nat_gateway_provider=nat_provider
)

nat_gateway_id = nat_provider.configured_gateways[0].gateway_id
(vpc.private_subnets[0]).add_ipv6_nat64_route(nat_gateway_id)

fn = lambda_.Function(self, "Lambda_with_IPv6_VPC",
    code=lambda_.InlineCode("def main(event, context): pass"),
    handler="index.main",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9,
    vpc=vpc,
    ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack=True
)
```

## Ephemeral Storage

You can configure ephemeral storage on a function to control the amount of storage it gets for reading
or writing data, allowing you to use AWS Lambda for ETL jobs, ML inference, or other data-intensive workloads.
The ephemeral storage will be accessible in the functions' `/tmp` directory.

```python
from aws_cdk import Size


fn = lambda_.Function(self, "MyFunction",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler")),
    ephemeral_storage_size=Size.mebibytes(1024)
)
```

Read more about using this feature in [this AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-lambda-now-supports-up-to-10-gb-ephemeral-storage/).

## Singleton Function

The `SingletonFunction` construct is a way to guarantee that a lambda function will be guaranteed to be part of the stack,
once and only once, irrespective of how many times the construct is declared to be part of the stack. This is guaranteed
as long as the `uuid` property and the optional `lambdaPurpose` property stay the same whenever they're declared into the
stack.

A typical use case of this function is when a higher level construct needs to declare a Lambda function as part of it but
needs to guarantee that the function is declared once. However, a user of this higher level construct can declare it any
number of times and with different properties. Using `SingletonFunction` here with a fixed `uuid` will guarantee this.

For example, the `AwsCustomResource` construct requires only one single lambda function for all api calls that are made.

## Bundling Asset Code

When using `lambda.Code.fromAsset(path)` it is possible to bundle the code by running a
command in a Docker container. The asset path will be mounted at `/asset-input`. The
Docker container is responsible for putting content at `/asset-output`. The content at
`/asset-output` will be zipped and used as Lambda code.

Example with Python:

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "Function",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "my-python-handler"),
        bundling=BundlingOptions(
            image=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9.bundling_image,
            command=["bash", "-c", "pip install -r requirements.txt -t /asset-output && cp -au . /asset-output"
            ]
        )
    ),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9,
    handler="index.handler"
)
```

Runtimes expose a `bundlingImage` property that points to the [AWS SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli) build image.

Use `cdk.DockerImage.fromRegistry(image)` to use an existing image or
`cdk.DockerImage.fromBuild(path)` to build a specific image:

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "Function",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset("/path/to/handler",
        bundling=BundlingOptions(
            image=DockerImage.from_build("/path/to/dir/with/DockerFile",
                build_args={
                    "ARG1": "value1"
                }
            ),
            command=["my", "cool", "command"]
        )
    ),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9,
    handler="index.handler"
)
```

## Language-specific APIs

Language-specific higher level constructs are provided in separate modules:

* `aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs`: [Github](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs) & [CDK Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda_nodejs-readme.html)
* `@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-python-alpha`: [Github](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/%40aws-cdk/aws-lambda-python-alpha) & [CDK Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-lambda-python-alpha-readme.html)

## Code Signing

Code signing for AWS Lambda helps to ensure that only trusted code runs in your Lambda functions.
When enabled, AWS Lambda checks every code deployment and verifies that the code package is signed by a trusted source.
For more information, see [Configuring code signing for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html).
The following code configures a function with code signing.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_signer as signer


signing_profile = signer.SigningProfile(self, "SigningProfile",
    platform=signer.Platform.AWS_LAMBDA_SHA384_ECDSA
)

code_signing_config = lambda_.CodeSigningConfig(self, "CodeSigningConfig",
    signing_profiles=[signing_profile]
)

lambda_.Function(self, "Function",
    code_signing_config=code_signing_config,
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)
```

## Runtime updates

Lambda runtime management controls help reduce the risk of impact to your workloads in the rare event of a runtime version incompatibility.
For more information, see [Runtime management controls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html#runtime-management-controls)

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "Lambda",
    runtime_management_mode=lambda_.RuntimeManagementMode.AUTO,
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)
```

If you want to set the "Manual" setting, using the ARN of the runtime version as the argument.

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "Lambda",
    runtime_management_mode=lambda_.RuntimeManagementMode.manual("runtimeVersion-arn"),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "lambda-handler"))
)
```

## Exclude Patterns for Assets

When using `lambda.Code.fromAsset(path)` an `exclude` property allows you to ignore particular files for assets by providing patterns for file paths to exclude. Note that this has no effect on `Assets` bundled using the `bundling` property.

The `ignoreMode` property can be used with the `exclude` property to specify the file paths to ignore based on the [.gitignore specification](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) or the [.dockerignore specification](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file). The default behavior is to ignore file paths based on simple glob patterns.

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "Function",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "my-python-handler"),
        exclude=["*.ignore"],
        ignore_mode=IgnoreMode.DOCKER
    ),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9,
    handler="index.handler"
)
```

You can also write to include only certain files by using a negation.

```python
lambda_.Function(self, "Function",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "my-python-handler"),
        exclude=["*", "!index.py"]
    ),
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.PYTHON_3_9,
    handler="index.handler"
)
```

        :param maximum_record_age_in_seconds: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) Discard records older than the specified age. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum age to infinite. When the value is set to infinite, Lambda never discards old records. .. epigraph:: The minimum valid value for maximum record age is 60s. Although values less than 60 and greater than -1 fall within the parameter's absolute range, they are not allowed
        :param maximum_retry_attempts: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) Discard records after the specified number of retries. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum number of retries to infinite. When MaximumRetryAttempts is infinite, Lambda retries failed records until the record expires in the event source.
        :param parallelization_factor: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) The number of batches to process concurrently from each shard. The default value is 1.
        :param queues: (Amazon MQ) The name of the Amazon MQ broker destination queue to consume.

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnEventSourceMapping``.

        :param function_name: The name or ARN of the Lambda function. **Name formats** - *Function name* – ``MyFunction`` . - *Function ARN* – ``arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:MyFunction`` . - *Version or Alias ARN* – ``arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:MyFunction:PROD`` . - *Partial ARN* – ``123456789012:function:MyFunction`` . The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify only the function name, it's limited to 64 characters in length.
        :param amazon_managed_kafka_event_source_config: Specific configuration settings for an Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) event source.
        :param batch_size: The maximum number of records in each batch that Lambda pulls from your stream or queue and sends to your function. Lambda passes all of the records in the batch to the function in a single call, up to the payload limit for synchronous invocation (6 MB). - *Amazon Kinesis* – Default 100. Max 10,000. - *Amazon DynamoDB Streams* – Default 100. Max 10,000. - *Amazon Simple Queue Service* – Default 10. For standard queues the max is 10,000. For FIFO queues the max is 10. - *Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka* – Default 100. Max 10,000. - *Self-managed Apache Kafka* – Default 100. Max 10,000. - *Amazon MQ (ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ)* – Default 100. Max 10,000. - *DocumentDB* – Default 100. Max 10,000.
        :param bisect_batch_on_function_error: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) If the function returns an error, split the batch in two and retry. The default value is false.
        :param destination_config: (Kinesis, DynamoDB Streams, Amazon MSK, and self-managed Apache Kafka event sources only) A configuration object that specifies the destination of an event after Lambda processes it.
        :param document_db_event_source_config: Specific configuration settings for a DocumentDB event source.
        :param enabled: When true, the event source mapping is active. When false, Lambda pauses polling and invocation. Default: True
        :param event_source_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event source. - *Amazon Kinesis* – The ARN of the data stream or a stream consumer. - *Amazon DynamoDB Streams* – The ARN of the stream. - *Amazon Simple Queue Service* – The ARN of the queue. - *Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka* – The ARN of the cluster or the ARN of the VPC connection (for `cross-account event source mappings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-msk.html#msk-multi-vpc>`_ ). - *Amazon MQ* – The ARN of the broker. - *Amazon DocumentDB* – The ARN of the DocumentDB change stream.
        :param filter_criteria: An object that defines the filter criteria that determine whether Lambda should process an event. For more information, see `Lambda event filtering <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventfiltering.html>`_ .
        :param function_response_types: (Streams and SQS) A list of current response type enums applied to the event source mapping. Valid Values: ``ReportBatchItemFailures``
        :param maximum_batching_window_in_seconds: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that Lambda spends gathering records before invoking the function. *Default ( Kinesis , DynamoDB , Amazon SQS event sources)* : 0 *Default ( Amazon MSK , Kafka, Amazon MQ , Amazon DocumentDB event sources)* : 500 ms *Related setting:* For Amazon SQS event sources, when you set ``BatchSize`` to a value greater than 10, you must set ``MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds`` to at least 1.
        :param maximum_record_age_in_seconds: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) Discard records older than the specified age. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum age to infinite. When the value is set to infinite, Lambda never discards old records. .. epigraph:: The minimum valid value for maximum record age is 60s. Although values less than 60 and greater than -1 fall within the parameter's absolute range, they are not allowed
        :param maximum_retry_attempts: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) Discard records after the specified number of retries. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum number of retries to infinite. When MaximumRetryAttempts is infinite, Lambda retries failed records until the record expires in the event source.
        :param parallelization_factor: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) The number of batches to process concurrently from each shard. The default value is 1.
        :param queues: (Amazon MQ) The name of the Amazon MQ broker destination queue to consume.
        :param scaling_config: (Amazon SQS only) The scaling configuration for the event source. For more information, see `Configuring maximum concurrency for Amazon SQS event sources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html#events-sqs-max-concurrency>`_ .
        :param self_managed_event_source: The self-managed Apache Kafka cluster for your event source.
        :param self_managed_kafka_event_source_config: Specific configuration settings for a self-managed Apache Kafka event source.
        :param source_access_configurations: An array of the authentication protocol, VPC components, or virtual host to secure and define your event source.
        :param starting_position: The position in a stream from which to start reading. Required for Amazon Kinesis and Amazon DynamoDB. - *LATEST* - Read only new records. - *TRIM_HORIZON* - Process all available records. - *AT_TIMESTAMP* - Specify a time from which to start reading records.
        :param starting_position_timestamp: With ``StartingPosition`` set to ``AT_TIMESTAMP`` , the time from which to start reading, in Unix time seconds. ``StartingPositionTimestamp`` cannot be in the future.
        :param topics: The name of the Kafka topic.
        :param tumbling_window_in_seconds: (Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams only) The duration in seconds of a processing window for DynamoDB and Kinesis Streams event sources. A value of 0 seconds indicates no tumbling window.

    '''The ``AWS::Lambda::Function`` resource creates a Lambda function.

    To create a function, you need a `deployment package <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html>`_ and an `execution role <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html>`_ . The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.

    You set the package type to ``Image`` if the deployment package is a `container image <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html>`_ . For a container image, the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties.

    You set the package type to ``Zip`` if the deployment package is a `.zip file archive <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip>`_ . For a .zip file archive, the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. For a Python example, see `Deploy Python Lambda functions with .zip file archives <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package.html>`_ .

    You can use `code signing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-codesigning.html>`_ if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with ``UpdateFunctionCode`` , Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.

    Note that you configure `provisioned concurrency <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/provisioned-concurrency.html>`_ on a ``AWS::Lambda::Version`` or a ``AWS::Lambda::Alias`` .

    For a complete introduction to Lambda functions, see `What is Lambda? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-welcome.html>`_ in the *Lambda developer guide.*

        :param scope: Scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: Construct identifier for this resource (unique in its scope).
        :param code: The code for the function.
        :param role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role.
        :param architectures: The instruction set architecture that the function supports. Enter a string array with one of the valid values (arm64 or x86_64). The default value is ``x86_64`` .
        :param code_signing_config_arn: To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. A code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.
        :param dead_letter_config: A dead-letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For more information, see `Dead-letter queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq>`_ .
        :param description: A description of the function.
        :param environment: Environment variables that are accessible from function code during execution.
        :param ephemeral_storage: The size of the function's ``/tmp`` directory in MB. The default value is 512, but it can be any whole number between 512 and 10,240 MB.
        :param file_system_configs: Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system. To connect a function to a file system, a mount target must be available in every Availability Zone that your function connects to. If your template contains an `AWS::EFS::MountTarget <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-efs-mounttarget.html>`_ resource, you must also specify a ``DependsOn`` attribute to ensure that the mount target is created or updated before the function. For more information about using the ``DependsOn`` attribute, see `DependsOn Attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html>`_ .
        :param function_name: The name of the Lambda function, up to 64 characters in length. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates one. If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param handler: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to run your function. Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see `Lambda programming model <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html>`_ .
        :param image_config: Configuration values that override the container image Dockerfile settings. For more information, see `Container image settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-parms>`_ .
        :param kms_key_arn: The ARN of the AWS Key Management Service ( AWS KMS ) customer managed key that's used to encrypt your function's `environment variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-encryption>`_ . When `Lambda SnapStart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart-security.html>`_ is activated, Lambda also uses this key is to encrypt your function's snapshot. If you deploy your function using a container image, Lambda also uses this key to encrypt your function when it's deployed. Note that this is not the same key that's used to protect your container image in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). If you don't provide a customer managed key, Lambda uses a default service key.
        :param layers: A list of `function layers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html>`_ to add to the function's execution environment. Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.
        :param logging_config: The function's Amazon CloudWatch Logs configuration settings.
        :param memory_size: The amount of `memory available to the function <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-memory-console>`_ at runtime. Increasing the function memory also increases its CPU allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value can be any multiple of 1 MB. Note that new AWS accounts have reduced concurrency and memory quotas. AWS raises these quotas automatically based on your usage. You can also request a quota increase.
        :param package_type: The type of deployment package. Set to ``Image`` for container image and set ``Zip`` for .zip file archive.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The number of simultaneous executions to reserve for the function.
        :param runtime: The identifier of the function's `runtime <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html>`_ . Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. The following list includes deprecated runtimes. For more information, see `Runtime deprecation policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtime-support-policy>`_ .
        :param runtime_management_config: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. For more information, see `Runtime updates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html>`_ .
        :param snap_start: The function's `AWS Lambda SnapStart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html>`_ setting.
        :param tags: A list of `tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tagging.html>`_ to apply to the function.
        :param timeout: The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run before stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 900 seconds. For more information, see `Lambda execution environment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html>`_ .
        :param tracing_config: Set ``Mode`` to ``Active`` to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests with `X-Ray <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html>`_ .
        :param vpc_config: For network connectivity to AWS resources in a VPC, specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you connect a function to a VPC, it can access resources and the internet only through that VPC. For more information, see `Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html>`_ .

If you include your function source inline with this parameter, AWS CloudFormation places it in a file named ``index`` and zips it to create a `deployment package <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html>`_ . This zip file cannot exceed 4MB. For the ``Handler`` property, the first part of the handler identifier must be ``index`` . For example, ``index.handler`` . For JSON, you must escape quotes and special characters such as newline ( ``\\n`` ) with a backslash. If you specify a function that interacts with an AWS CloudFormation custom resource, you don't have to write your own functions to send responses to the custom resource that invoked the function. AWS CloudFormation provides a response module ( `cfn-response <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-lambda-function-code-cfnresponsemodule.html>`_ ) that simplifies sending responses. See `Using AWS Lambda with AWS CloudFormation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-cloudformation.html>`_ for details.

This zip file cannot exceed 4MB. For the ``Handler`` property, the first part of the handler identifier must be ``index`` . For example, ``index.handler`` .

            For JSON, you must escape quotes and special characters such as newline ( ``\\n`` ) with a backslash.

            If you specify a function that interacts with an AWS CloudFormation custom resource, you don't have to write your own functions to send responses to the custom resource that invoked the function. AWS CloudFormation provides a response module ( `cfn-response <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-lambda-function-code-cfnresponsemodule.html>`_ ) that simplifies sending responses.

        :param architectures: The instruction set architecture that the function supports. Enter a string array with one of the valid values (arm64 or x86_64). The default value is ``x86_64`` .
        :param code_signing_config_arn: To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. A code-signing configuration includes a set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.
        :param dead_letter_config: A dead-letter queue configuration that specifies the queue or topic where Lambda sends asynchronous events when they fail processing. For more information, see `Dead-letter queues <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq>`_ .
        :param description: A description of the function.
        :param environment: Environment variables that are accessible from function code during execution.
        :param ephemeral_storage: The size of the function's ``/tmp`` directory in MB. The default value is 512, but it can be any whole number between 512 and 10,240 MB.
        :param file_system_configs: Connection settings for an Amazon EFS file system. To connect a function to a file system, a mount target must be available in every Availability Zone that your function connects to. If your template contains an `AWS::EFS::MountTarget <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-efs-mounttarget.html>`_ resource, you must also specify a ``DependsOn`` attribute to ensure that the mount target is created or updated before the function. For more information about using the ``DependsOn`` attribute, see `DependsOn Attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html>`_ .
        :param function_name: The name of the Lambda function, up to 64 characters in length. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates one. If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param handler: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to run your function. Handler is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see `Lambda programming model <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html>`_ .
        :param image_config: Configuration values that override the container image Dockerfile settings. For more information, see `Container image settings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html#images-parms>`_ .
        :param kms_key_arn: The ARN of the AWS Key Management Service ( AWS KMS ) customer managed key that's used to encrypt your function's `environment variables <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-encryption>`_ . When `Lambda SnapStart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart-security.html>`_ is activated, Lambda also uses this key is to encrypt your function's snapshot. If you deploy your function using a container image, Lambda also uses this key to encrypt your function when it's deployed. Note that this is not the same key that's used to protect your container image in the Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). If you don't provide a customer managed key, Lambda uses a default service key.
        :param layers: A list of `function layers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html>`_ to add to the function's execution environment. Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.
        :param logging_config: The function's Amazon CloudWatch Logs configuration settings.
        :param memory_size: The amount of `memory available to the function <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-function-common.html#configuration-memory-console>`_ at runtime. Increasing the function memory also increases its CPU allocation. The default value is 128 MB. The value can be any multiple of 1 MB. Note that new AWS accounts have reduced concurrency and memory quotas. AWS raises these quotas automatically based on your usage. You can also request a quota increase.
        :param package_type: The type of deployment package. Set to ``Image`` for container image and set ``Zip`` for .zip file archive.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The number of simultaneous executions to reserve for the function.
        :param runtime: The identifier of the function's `runtime <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html>`_ . Runtime is required if the deployment package is a .zip file archive. The following list includes deprecated runtimes. For more information, see `Runtime deprecation policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html#runtime-support-policy>`_ .
        :param runtime_management_config: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. For more information, see `Runtime updates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html>`_ .
        :param snap_start: The function's `AWS Lambda SnapStart <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/snapstart.html>`_ setting.
        :param tags: A list of `tags <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/tagging.html>`_ to apply to the function.
        :param timeout: The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run before stopping it. The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 900 seconds. For more information, see `Lambda execution environment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html>`_ .
        :param tracing_config: Set ``Mode`` to ``Active`` to sample and trace a subset of incoming requests with `X-Ray <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html>`_ .
        :param vpc_config: For network connectivity to AWS resources in a VPC, specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC. When you connect a function to a VPC, it can access resources and the internet only through that VPC. For more information, see `Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html>`_ .

    '''The ``AWS::Lambda::Permission`` resource grants an AWS service or another account permission to use a function.

    You can apply the policy at the function level, or specify a qualifier to restrict access to a single version or alias. If you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of that version or alias to invoke the function.

    To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID as the ``Principal`` . To grant permission to an organization defined in AWS Organizations , specify the organization ID as the ``PrincipalOrgID`` . For AWS services, the principal is a domain-style identifier defined by the service, like ``s3.amazonaws.com`` or ``sns.amazonaws.com`` . For AWS services, you can also specify the ARN of the associated resource as the ``SourceArn`` . If you grant permission to a service principal without specifying the source, other accounts could potentially configure resources in their account to invoke your Lambda function.

    If your function has a function URL, you can specify the ``FunctionUrlAuthType`` parameter. This adds a condition to your permission that only applies when your function URL's ``AuthType`` matches the specified ``FunctionUrlAuthType`` . For more information about the ``AuthType`` parameter, see `Security and auth model for Lambda function URLs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-auth.html>`_ .

    This resource adds a statement to a resource-based permission policy for the function. For more information about function policies, see `Lambda Function Policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html>`_ .

        '''Non runtime options.

        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param application_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param application_log_level_v2: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: ApplicationLogLevel.INFO
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified

In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param code: The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.
        :param handler: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your function. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html. Use ``Handler.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image. NOTE: If you specify your source code as inline text by specifying the ZipFile property within the Code property, specify index.function_name as the handler.
        :param runtime: The runtime environment for the Lambda function that you are uploading. For valid values, see the Runtime property in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Use ``Runtime.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image.

This entity can be any of the following: - a valid AWS service principal, such as ``s3.amazonaws.com`` or ``sns.amazonaws.com`` - an AWS account ID for cross-account permissions. For example, you might want to allow a custom application in another AWS account to push events to Lambda by invoking your function. - an AWS organization principal to grant permissions to an entire organization. The principal can be an AccountPrincipal, an ArnPrincipal, a ServicePrincipal, or an OrganizationPrincipal.
        :param action: The Lambda actions that you want to allow in this statement. For example, you can specify lambda:CreateFunction to specify a certain action, or use a wildcard (``lambda:*``) to grant permission to all Lambda actions. For a list of actions, see Actions and Condition Context Keys for AWS Lambda in the IAM User Guide. Default: 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
        :param event_source_token: A unique token that must be supplied by the principal invoking the function. Default: - The caller would not need to present a token.
        :param function_url_auth_type: The authType for the function URL that you are granting permissions for. Default: - No functionUrlAuthType
        :param organization_id: The organization you want to grant permissions to. Use this ONLY if you need to grant permissions to a subset of the organization. If you want to grant permissions to the entire organization, sending the organization principal through the ``principal`` property will suffice. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific organization. Default: - No organizationId
        :param scope: The scope to which the permission constructs be attached. The default is the Lambda function construct itself, but this would need to be different in cases such as cross-stack references where the Permissions would need to sit closer to the consumer of this permission (i.e., the caller). Default: - The instance of lambda.IFunction
        :param source_account: The AWS account ID (without hyphens) of the source owner. For example, if you specify an S3 bucket in the SourceArn property, this value is the bucket owner's account ID. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific account.
        :param source_arn: The ARN of a resource that is invoking your function. When granting Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) permission to invoke your function, specify this property with the bucket ARN as its value. This ensures that events generated only from the specified bucket, not just any bucket from any AWS account that creates a mapping to your function, can invoke the function.

        :param id: The id for the permission construct.

This entity can be any of the following: - a valid AWS service principal, such as ``s3.amazonaws.com`` or ``sns.amazonaws.com`` - an AWS account ID for cross-account permissions. For example, you might want to allow a custom application in another AWS account to push events to Lambda by invoking your function. - an AWS organization principal to grant permissions to an entire organization. The principal can be an AccountPrincipal, an ArnPrincipal, a ServicePrincipal, or an OrganizationPrincipal.
        :param action: The Lambda actions that you want to allow in this statement. For example, you can specify lambda:CreateFunction to specify a certain action, or use a wildcard (``lambda:*``) to grant permission to all Lambda actions. For a list of actions, see Actions and Condition Context Keys for AWS Lambda in the IAM User Guide. Default: 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
        :param event_source_token: A unique token that must be supplied by the principal invoking the function. Default: - The caller would not need to present a token.
        :param function_url_auth_type: The authType for the function URL that you are granting permissions for. Default: - No functionUrlAuthType
        :param organization_id: The organization you want to grant permissions to. Use this ONLY if you need to grant permissions to a subset of the organization. If you want to grant permissions to the entire organization, sending the organization principal through the ``principal`` property will suffice. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific organization. Default: - No organizationId
        :param scope: The scope to which the permission constructs be attached. The default is the Lambda function construct itself, but this would need to be different in cases such as cross-stack references where the Permissions would need to sit closer to the consumer of this permission (i.e., the caller). Default: - The instance of lambda.IFunction
        :param source_account: The AWS account ID (without hyphens) of the source owner. For example, if you specify an S3 bucket in the SourceArn property, this value is the bucket owner's account ID. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific account.
        :param source_arn: The ARN of a resource that is invoking your function. When granting Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) permission to invoke your function, specify this property with the bucket ARN as its value. This ensures that events generated only from the specified bucket, not just any bucket from any AWS account that creates a mapping to your function, can invoke the function.

This entity can be any of the following: - a valid AWS service principal, such as ``s3.amazonaws.com`` or ``sns.amazonaws.com`` - an AWS account ID for cross-account permissions. For example, you might want to allow a custom application in another AWS account to push events to Lambda by invoking your function. - an AWS organization principal to grant permissions to an entire organization. The principal can be an AccountPrincipal, an ArnPrincipal, a ServicePrincipal, or an OrganizationPrincipal.
        :param action: The Lambda actions that you want to allow in this statement. For example, you can specify lambda:CreateFunction to specify a certain action, or use a wildcard (``lambda:*``) to grant permission to all Lambda actions. For a list of actions, see Actions and Condition Context Keys for AWS Lambda in the IAM User Guide. Default: 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
        :param event_source_token: A unique token that must be supplied by the principal invoking the function. Default: - The caller would not need to present a token.
        :param function_url_auth_type: The authType for the function URL that you are granting permissions for. Default: - No functionUrlAuthType
        :param organization_id: The organization you want to grant permissions to. Use this ONLY if you need to grant permissions to a subset of the organization. If you want to grant permissions to the entire organization, sending the organization principal through the ``principal`` property will suffice. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific organization. Default: - No organizationId
        :param scope: The scope to which the permission constructs be attached. The default is the Lambda function construct itself, but this would need to be different in cases such as cross-stack references where the Permissions would need to sit closer to the consumer of this permission (i.e., the caller). Default: - The instance of lambda.IFunction
        :param source_account: The AWS account ID (without hyphens) of the source owner. For example, if you specify an S3 bucket in the SourceArn property, this value is the bucket owner's account ID. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific account.
        :param source_arn: The ARN of a resource that is invoking your function. When granting Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) permission to invoke your function, specify this property with the bucket ARN as its value. This ensures that events generated only from the specified bucket, not just any bucket from any AWS account that creates a mapping to your function, can invoke the function.

        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param application_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param application_log_level_v2: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: ApplicationLogLevel.INFO
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param code: The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.
        :param handler: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your function. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html. Use ``Handler.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image. NOTE: If you specify your source code as inline text by specifying the ZipFile property within the Code property, specify index.function_name as the handler.
        :param runtime: The runtime environment for the Lambda function that you are uploading. For valid values, see the Runtime property in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Use ``Runtime.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image.
        :param uuid: A unique identifier to identify this lambda. The identifier should be unique across all custom resource providers. We recommend generating a UUID per provider.
        :param lambda_purpose: A descriptive name for the purpose of this Lambda. If the Lambda does not have a physical name, this string will be reflected its generated name. The combination of lambdaPurpose and uuid must be unique. Default: SingletonLambda

For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash.

The Docker container is responsible for putting content at ``/asset-output``. The content at ``/asset-output`` will be zipped and used as the final asset.

        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param application_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param application_log_level_v2: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: ApplicationLogLevel.INFO
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param code: The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.

This entity can be any of the following: - a valid AWS service principal, such as ``s3.amazonaws.com`` or ``sns.amazonaws.com`` - an AWS account ID for cross-account permissions. For example, you might want to allow a custom application in another AWS account to push events to Lambda by invoking your function. - an AWS organization principal to grant permissions to an entire organization. The principal can be an AccountPrincipal, an ArnPrincipal, a ServicePrincipal, or an OrganizationPrincipal.
        :param action: The Lambda actions that you want to allow in this statement. For example, you can specify lambda:CreateFunction to specify a certain action, or use a wildcard (``lambda:*``) to grant permission to all Lambda actions. For a list of actions, see Actions and Condition Context Keys for AWS Lambda in the IAM User Guide. Default: 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
        :param event_source_token: A unique token that must be supplied by the principal invoking the function. Default: - The caller would not need to present a token.
        :param function_url_auth_type: The authType for the function URL that you are granting permissions for. Default: - No functionUrlAuthType
        :param organization_id: The organization you want to grant permissions to. Use this ONLY if you need to grant permissions to a subset of the organization. If you want to grant permissions to the entire organization, sending the organization principal through the ``principal`` property will suffice. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific organization. Default: - No organizationId
        :param scope: The scope to which the permission constructs be attached. The default is the Lambda function construct itself, but this would need to be different in cases such as cross-stack references where the Permissions would need to sit closer to the consumer of this permission (i.e., the caller). Default: - The instance of lambda.IFunction
        :param source_account: The AWS account ID (without hyphens) of the source owner. For example, if you specify an S3 bucket in the SourceArn property, this value is the bucket owner's account ID. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific account.
        :param source_arn: The ARN of a resource that is invoking your function. When granting Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) permission to invoke your function, specify this property with the bucket ARN as its value. This ensures that events generated only from the specified bucket, not just any bucket from any AWS account that creates a mapping to your function, can invoke the function.

        :param lambda_purpose: A descriptive name for the purpose of this Lambda. If the Lambda does not have a physical name, this string will be reflected its generated name. The combination of lambdaPurpose and uuid must be unique. Default: SingletonLambda
        :param code: The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.
        :param handler: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your function. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html. Use ``Handler.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image. NOTE: If you specify your source code as inline text by specifying the ZipFile property within the Code property, specify index.function_name as the handler.
        :param runtime: The runtime environment for the Lambda function that you are uploading. For valid values, see the Runtime property in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Use ``Runtime.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image.
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false

        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2

This entity can be any of the following: - a valid AWS service principal, such as ``s3.amazonaws.com`` or ``sns.amazonaws.com`` - an AWS account ID for cross-account permissions. For example, you might want to allow a custom application in another AWS account to push events to Lambda by invoking your function. - an AWS organization principal to grant permissions to an entire organization. The principal can be an AccountPrincipal, an ArnPrincipal, a ServicePrincipal, or an OrganizationPrincipal.
        :param action: The Lambda actions that you want to allow in this statement. For example, you can specify lambda:CreateFunction to specify a certain action, or use a wildcard (``lambda:*``) to grant permission to all Lambda actions. For a list of actions, see Actions and Condition Context Keys for AWS Lambda in the IAM User Guide. Default: 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
        :param event_source_token: A unique token that must be supplied by the principal invoking the function. Default: - The caller would not need to present a token.
        :param function_url_auth_type: The authType for the function URL that you are granting permissions for. Default: - No functionUrlAuthType
        :param organization_id: The organization you want to grant permissions to. Use this ONLY if you need to grant permissions to a subset of the organization. If you want to grant permissions to the entire organization, sending the organization principal through the ``principal`` property will suffice. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific organization. Default: - No organizationId
        :param scope: The scope to which the permission constructs be attached. The default is the Lambda function construct itself, but this would need to be different in cases such as cross-stack references where the Permissions would need to sit closer to the consumer of this permission (i.e., the caller). Default: - The instance of lambda.IFunction
        :param source_account: The AWS account ID (without hyphens) of the source owner. For example, if you specify an S3 bucket in the SourceArn property, this value is the bucket owner's account ID. You can use this property to ensure that all source principals are owned by a specific account.
        :param source_arn: The ARN of a resource that is invoking your function. When granting Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) permission to invoke your function, specify this property with the bucket ARN as its value. This ensures that events generated only from the specified bucket, not just any bucket from any AWS account that creates a mapping to your function, can invoke the function.

You can use `dynamic labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`_ to show summary information about the entire displayed time series in the legend. For example, if you use:: [max: ${MAX}] MyMetric As the metric label, the maximum value in the visible range will be shown next to the time series name in the graph's legend. Default: - No label
        :param period: The period over which the specified statistic is applied. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param region: Region which this metric comes from. Default: - Deployment region.
        :param statistic: What function to use for aggregating. Use the ``aws_cloudwatch.Stats`` helper class to construct valid input strings. Can be one of the following: - "Minimum" | "min" - "Maximum" | "max" - "Average" | "avg" - "Sum" | "sum" - "SampleCount | "n" - "pNN.NN" - "tmNN.NN" | "tm(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" - "iqm" - "wmNN.NN" | "wm(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" - "tcNN.NN" | "tc(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" - "tsNN.NN" | "ts(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" Default: Average
        :param unit: Unit used to filter the metric stream. Only refer to datums emitted to the metric stream with the given unit and ignore all others. Only useful when datums are being emitted to the same metric stream under different units. The default is to use all matric datums in the stream, regardless of unit, which is recommended in nearly all cases. CloudWatch does not honor this property for graphs. Default: - All metric datums in the given metric stream

        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param code: The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.
        :param handler: The name of the method within your code that Lambda calls to execute your function. The format includes the file name. It can also include namespaces and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/foundation-progmodel.html. Use ``Handler.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image. NOTE: If you specify your source code as inline text by specifying the ZipFile property within the Code property, specify index.function_name as the handler.
        :param runtime: The runtime environment for the Lambda function that you are uploading. For valid values, see the Runtime property in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Use ``Runtime.FROM_IMAGE`` when defining a function from a Docker image.
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param application_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param application_log_level_v2: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: ApplicationLogLevel.INFO
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2

        '''
        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param code: The source code of your Lambda function. You can point to a file in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or specify your source code as inline text.
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param application_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param application_log_level_v2: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: ApplicationLogLevel.INFO
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2
