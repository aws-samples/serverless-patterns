# Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Construct Library

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

## Auto Scaling Group

An `AutoScalingGroup` represents a number of instances on which you run your code. You
pick the size of the fleet, the instance type and the OS image:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),

    # The latest Amazon Linux 2 image
    machine_image=ec2.MachineImage.latest_amazon_linux2()
)
```

Creating an `AutoScalingGroup` from a Launch Configuration has been deprecated. All new accounts created after December 31, 2023 will no longer be able to create Launch Configurations. With the `@aws-cdk/aws-autoscaling:generateLaunchTemplateInsteadOfLaunchConfig` feature flag set to true, `AutoScalingGroup` properties used to create a Launch Configuration will now be used to create a `LaunchTemplate` using a [Launch Configuration to `LaunchTemplate` mapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/migrate-launch-configurations-with-cloudformation.html#launch-configuration-mapping-reference). Specifically, the following `AutoScalingGroup` properties will be used to generate a `LaunchTemplate`:

* machineImage
* keyName (deprecated, prefer keyPair)
* keyPair
* instanceType
* instanceMonitoring
* securityGroup
* role
* userData
* associatePublicIpAddress
* spotPrice
* blockDevices

After the Launch Configuration is replaced with a `LaunchTemplate`, any new instances launched by the `AutoScalingGroup` will use the new `LaunchTemplate`. Existing instances are not affected. To update an existing instance, you can allow the `AutoScalingGroup` to gradually replace existing instances with new instances based on the `terminationPolicies` for the `AutoScalingGroup`. Alternatively, you can terminate them yourself and force the `AutoScalingGroup` to launch new instances to maintain the `desiredCapacity`.

Support for creating an `AutoScalingGroup` from a `LaunchTemplate` was added in CDK version 2.21.0. Users on a CDK version earlier than version 2.21.0 that need to create an `AutoScalingGroup` with an account created after December 31, 2023 must update their CDK version to 2.21.0 or later. Users on CDK versions 2.21.0 up to, but not including 2.86.0, must use a manually created `LaunchTemplate` to create an `AutoScalingGroup` for accounts created after December 31, 2023. CDK version 2.86.0 or later will automatically generate a `LaunchTemplate` using the `AutoScalingGroup` properties mentioned above.

For additional migration information, please see: [Migrating to a `LaunchTemplate` from a Launch Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/migrate-to-launch-templates.html)

NOTE: AutoScalingGroup has a property called `allowAllOutbound` (allowing the instances to contact the
internet) which is set to `true` by default. Be sure to set this to `false`  if you don't want
your instances to be able to start arbitrary connections. Alternatively, you can specify an existing security
group to attach to the instances that are launched, rather than have the group create a new one.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


my_security_group = ec2.SecurityGroup(self, "SecurityGroup", vpc=vpc)
autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),
    machine_image=ec2.MachineImage.latest_amazon_linux2(),
    security_group=my_security_group
)
```

Alternatively, to enable more advanced features, you can create an `AutoScalingGroup` from a supplied `LaunchTemplate`:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# launch_template: ec2.LaunchTemplate


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    launch_template=launch_template
)
```

To launch a mixture of Spot and on-demand instances, and/or with multiple instance types, you can create an `AutoScalingGroup` from a `MixedInstancesPolicy`:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# launch_template1: ec2.LaunchTemplate
# launch_template2: ec2.LaunchTemplate


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    mixed_instances_policy=autoscaling.MixedInstancesPolicy(
        instances_distribution=autoscaling.InstancesDistribution(
            on_demand_percentage_above_base_capacity=50
        ),
        launch_template=launch_template1,
        launch_template_overrides=[autoscaling.LaunchTemplateOverrides(instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t3.micro")), autoscaling.LaunchTemplateOverrides(instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t3a.micro")), autoscaling.LaunchTemplateOverrides(instance_type=ec2.InstanceType("t4g.micro"), launch_template=launch_template2)]
    )
)
```

You can specify instances requirements with the `instanceRequirements ` property:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# launch_template1: ec2.LaunchTemplate


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    mixed_instances_policy=autoscaling.MixedInstancesPolicy(
        launch_template=launch_template1,
        launch_template_overrides=[autoscaling.LaunchTemplateOverrides(
            instance_requirements=autoscaling.CfnAutoScalingGroup.InstanceRequirementsProperty(
                v_cpu_count=autoscaling.CfnAutoScalingGroup.VCpuCountRequestProperty(min=4, max=8),
                memory_mi_b=autoscaling.CfnAutoScalingGroup.MemoryMiBRequestProperty(min=16384),
                cpu_manufacturers=["intel"]
            )
        )
        ]
    )
)
```

## Machine Images (AMIs)

AMIs control the OS that gets launched when you start your EC2 instance. The EC2
library contains constructs to select the AMI you want to use.

Depending on the type of AMI, you select it a different way.

The latest version of Amazon Linux and Microsoft Windows images are
selectable by instantiating one of these classes:

```python
# Pick a Windows edition to use
windows = ec2.WindowsImage(ec2.WindowsVersion.WINDOWS_SERVER_2019_ENGLISH_FULL_BASE)

# Pick the right Amazon Linux edition. All arguments shown are optional
# and will default to these values when omitted.
amzn_linux = ec2.AmazonLinuxImage(
    generation=ec2.AmazonLinuxGeneration.AMAZON_LINUX,
    edition=ec2.AmazonLinuxEdition.STANDARD,
    virtualization=ec2.AmazonLinuxVirt.HVM,
    storage=ec2.AmazonLinuxStorage.GENERAL_PURPOSE
)

# For other custom (Linux) images, instantiate a `GenericLinuxImage` with
# a map giving the AMI to in for each region:

linux = ec2.GenericLinuxImage({
    "us-east-1": "ami-97785bed",
    "eu-west-1": "ami-12345678"
})
```

> NOTE: The Amazon Linux images selected will be cached in your `cdk.json`, so that your
> AutoScalingGroups don't automatically change out from under you when you're making unrelated
> changes. To update to the latest version of Amazon Linux, remove the cache entry from the `context`
> section of your `cdk.json`.
>
> We will add command-line options to make this step easier in the future.

## AutoScaling Instance Counts

AutoScalingGroups make it possible to raise and lower the number of instances in the group,
in response to (or in advance of) changes in workload.

When you create your AutoScalingGroup, you specify a `minCapacity` and a
`maxCapacity`. AutoScaling policies that respond to metrics will never go higher
or lower than the indicated capacity (but scheduled scaling actions might, see
below).

There are three ways to scale your capacity:

* **In response to a metric** (also known as step scaling); for example, you
  might want to scale out if the CPU usage across your cluster starts to rise,
  and scale in when it drops again.
* **By trying to keep a certain metric around a given value** (also known as
  target tracking scaling); you might want to automatically scale out and in to
  keep your CPU usage around 50%.
* **On a schedule**; you might want to organize your scaling around traffic
  flows you expect, by scaling out in the morning and scaling in in the
  evening.

The general pattern of autoscaling will look like this:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


auto_scaling_group = autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    min_capacity=5,
    max_capacity=100
)
```

### Step Scaling

This type of scaling scales in and out in deterministics steps that you
configure, in response to metric values. For example, your scaling strategy to
scale in response to a metric that represents your average worker pool usage
might look like this:

```plaintext
 Scaling        -1          (no change)          +1       +3
            │        │                       │        │        │
            ├────────┼───────────────────────┼────────┼────────┤
            │        │                       │        │        │
Worker use  0%      10%                     50%       70%     100%
```

(Note that this is not necessarily a recommended scaling strategy, but it's
a possible one. You will have to determine what thresholds are right for you).

Note that in order to set up this scaling strategy, you will have to emit a
metric representing your worker utilization from your instances. After that,
you would configure the scaling something like this:

```python
# auto_scaling_group: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


worker_utilization_metric = cloudwatch.Metric(
    namespace="MyService",
    metric_name="WorkerUtilization"
)

auto_scaling_group.scale_on_metric("ScaleToCPU",
    metric=worker_utilization_metric,
    scaling_steps=[autoscaling.ScalingInterval(upper=10, change=-1), autoscaling.ScalingInterval(lower=50, change=+1), autoscaling.ScalingInterval(lower=70, change=+3)
    ],
    evaluation_periods=10,
    datapoints_to_alarm=5,

    # Change this to AdjustmentType.PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY to interpret the
    # 'change' numbers before as percentages instead of capacity counts.
    adjustment_type=autoscaling.AdjustmentType.CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY
)
```

The AutoScaling construct library will create the required CloudWatch alarms and
AutoScaling policies for you.

### Target Tracking Scaling

This type of scaling scales in and out in order to keep a metric around a value
you prefer. There are four types of predefined metrics you can track, or you can
choose to track a custom metric. If you do choose to track a custom metric,
be aware that the metric has to represent instance utilization in some way
(AutoScaling will scale out if the metric is higher than the target, and scale
in if the metric is lower than the target).

If you configure multiple target tracking policies, AutoScaling will use the
one that yields the highest capacity.

The following example scales to keep the CPU usage of your instances around
50% utilization:

```python
# auto_scaling_group: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


auto_scaling_group.scale_on_cpu_utilization("KeepSpareCPU",
    target_utilization_percent=50
)
```

To scale on average network traffic in and out of your instances:

```python
# auto_scaling_group: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


auto_scaling_group.scale_on_incoming_bytes("LimitIngressPerInstance",
    target_bytes_per_second=10 * 1024 * 1024
)
auto_scaling_group.scale_on_outgoing_bytes("LimitEgressPerInstance",
    target_bytes_per_second=10 * 1024 * 1024
)
```

To scale on the average request count per instance (only works for
AutoScalingGroups that have been attached to Application Load
Balancers):

```python
# auto_scaling_group: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


auto_scaling_group.scale_on_request_count("LimitRPS",
    target_requests_per_second=1000
)
```

### Scheduled Scaling

This type of scaling is used to change capacities based on time. It works by
changing `minCapacity`, `maxCapacity` and `desiredCapacity` of the
AutoScalingGroup, and so can be used for two purposes:

* Scale in and out on a schedule by setting the `minCapacity` high or
  the `maxCapacity` low.
* Still allow the regular scaling actions to do their job, but restrict
  the range they can scale over (by setting both `minCapacity` and
  `maxCapacity` but changing their range over time).

A schedule is expressed as a cron expression. The `Schedule` class has a `cron` method to help build cron expressions.

The following example scales the fleet out in the morning, going back to natural
scaling (all the way down to 1 instance if necessary) at night:

```python
# auto_scaling_group: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


auto_scaling_group.scale_on_schedule("PrescaleInTheMorning",
    schedule=autoscaling.Schedule.cron(hour="8", minute="0"),
    min_capacity=20
)

auto_scaling_group.scale_on_schedule("AllowDownscalingAtNight",
    schedule=autoscaling.Schedule.cron(hour="20", minute="0"),
    min_capacity=1
)
```

### Instance Maintenance Policy

You can configure an instance maintenance policy for your Auto Scaling group to
meet specific capacity requirements during events that cause instances to be replaced,
such as an instance refresh or the health check process.

For example, suppose you have an Auto Scaling group that has a small number of instances.
You want to avoid the potential disruptions from terminating and then replacing an instance
when health checks indicate an impaired instance. With an instance maintenance policy, you
can make sure that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling first launches a new instance and then waits for
it to be fully ready before terminating the unhealthy instance.

An instance maintenance policy also helps you minimize any potential disruptions in cases where
multiple instances are replaced at the same time. You set the `minHealthyPercentage`
and the `maxHealthyPercentage` for the policy, and your Auto Scaling group can only
increase and decrease capacity within that minimum-maximum range when replacing instances.
A larger range increases the number of instances that can be replaced at the same time.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),
    machine_image=ec2.MachineImage.latest_amazon_linux2(),
    max_healthy_percentage=200,
    min_healthy_percentage=100
)
```

> Visit [Instance maintenance policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.html) for more details.

### Block Devices

This type specifies how block devices are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes.

#### GP3 Volumes

You can only specify the `throughput` on GP3 volumes.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


auto_scaling_group = autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,
    block_devices=[autoscaling.BlockDevice(
        device_name="gp3-volume",
        volume=autoscaling.BlockDeviceVolume.ebs(15,
            volume_type=autoscaling.EbsDeviceVolumeType.GP3,
            throughput=125
        )
    )
    ]
)
```

## Configuring Instances using CloudFormation Init

It is possible to use the CloudFormation Init mechanism to configure the
instances in the AutoScalingGroup. You can write files to it, run commands,
start services, etc. See the documentation of
[AWS::CloudFormation::Init](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html)
and the documentation of CDK's `aws-ec2` library for more information.

When you specify a CloudFormation Init configuration for an AutoScalingGroup:

* you *must* also specify `signals` to configure how long CloudFormation
  should wait for the instances to successfully configure themselves.
* you *should* also specify an `updatePolicy` to configure how instances
  should be updated when the AutoScalingGroup is updated (for example,
  when the AMI is updated). If you don't specify an update policy, a *rolling
  update* is chosen by default.

Here's an example of using CloudFormation Init to write a file to the
instance hosts on startup:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    init=ec2.CloudFormationInit.from_elements(
        ec2.InitFile.from_string("/etc/my_instance", "This got written during instance startup")),
    signals=autoscaling.Signals.wait_for_all(
        timeout=Duration.minutes(10)
    )
)
```

## Signals

In normal operation, CloudFormation will send a Create or Update command to
an AutoScalingGroup and proceed with the rest of the deployment without waiting
for the *instances in the AutoScalingGroup*.

Configure `signals` to tell CloudFormation to wait for a specific number of
instances in the AutoScalingGroup to have been started (or failed to start)
before moving on. An instance is supposed to execute the
[`cfn-signal`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-signal.html)
program as part of its startup to indicate whether it was started
successfully or not.

If you use CloudFormation Init support (described in the previous section),
the appropriate call to `cfn-signal` is automatically added to the
AutoScalingGroup's UserData. If you don't use the `signals` directly, you are
responsible for adding such a call yourself.

The following type of `Signals` are available:

* `Signals.waitForAll([options])`: wait for all of `desiredCapacity` amount of instances
  to have started (recommended).
* `Signals.waitForMinCapacity([options])`: wait for a `minCapacity` amount of instances
  to have started (use this if waiting for all instances takes too long and you are happy
  with a minimum count of healthy hosts).
* `Signals.waitForCount(count, [options])`: wait for a specific amount of instances to have
  started.

There are two `options` you can configure:

* `timeout`: maximum time a host startup is allowed to take. If a host does not report
  success within this time, it is considered a failure. Default is 5 minutes.
* `minSuccessPercentage`: percentage of hosts that needs to be healthy in order for the
  update to succeed. If you set this value lower than 100, some percentage of hosts may
  report failure, while still considering the deployment a success. Default is 100%.

## Update Policy

The *update policy* describes what should happen to running instances when the definition
of the AutoScalingGroup is changed. For example, if you add a command to the UserData
of an AutoScalingGroup, do the existing instances get replaced with new instances that
have executed the new UserData? Or do the "old" instances just keep on running?

It is recommended to always use an update policy, otherwise the current state of your
instances also depends the previous state of your instances, rather than just on your
source code. This degrades the reproducibility of your deployments.

The following update policies are available:

* `UpdatePolicy.none()`: leave existing instances alone (not recommended).
* `UpdatePolicy.rollingUpdate([options])`: progressively replace the existing
  instances with new instances, in small batches. At any point in time,
  roughly the same amount of total instances will be running. If the deployment
  needs to be rolled back, the fresh instances will be replaced with the "old"
  configuration again.
* `UpdatePolicy.replacingUpdate([options])`: build a completely fresh copy
  of the new AutoScalingGroup next to the old one. Once the AutoScalingGroup
  has been successfully created (and the instances started, if `signals` is
  configured on the AutoScalingGroup), the old AutoScalingGroup is deleted.
  If the deployment needs to be rolled back, the new AutoScalingGroup is
  deleted and the old one is left unchanged.

## Allowing Connections

See the documentation of the `aws-cdk-lib/aws-ec2` package for more information
about allowing connections between resources backed by instances.

## Max Instance Lifetime

To enable the max instance lifetime support, specify `maxInstanceLifetime` property
for the `AutoscalingGroup` resource. The value must be between 7 and 365 days(inclusive).
To clear a previously set value, leave this property undefined.

## Instance Monitoring

To disable detailed instance monitoring, specify `instanceMonitoring` property
for the `AutoscalingGroup` resource as `Monitoring.BASIC`. Otherwise detailed monitoring
will be enabled.

## Monitoring Group Metrics

Group metrics are used to monitor group level properties; they describe the group rather than any of its instances (e.g GroupMaxSize, the group maximum size). To enable group metrics monitoring, use the `groupMetrics` property.
All group metrics are reported in a granularity of 1 minute at no additional charge.

See [EC2 docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-monitoring.html#as-group-metrics) for a list of all available group metrics.

To enable group metrics monitoring using the `groupMetrics` property:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


# Enable monitoring of all group metrics
autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    group_metrics=[autoscaling.GroupMetrics.all()]
)

# Enable monitoring for a subset of group metrics
autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    group_metrics=[autoscaling.GroupMetrics(autoscaling.GroupMetric.MIN_SIZE, autoscaling.GroupMetric.MAX_SIZE)]
)
```

## Termination policies

Auto Scaling uses [termination policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html)
to determine which instances it terminates first during scale-in events. You
can specify one or more termination policies with the `terminationPolicies`
property:

[Custom termination policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lambda-custom-termination-policy.html) with lambda
can be used to determine which instances to terminate based on custom logic.
The custom termination policy can be specified using `TerminationPolicy.CUSTOM_LAMBDA_FUNCTION`. If this is
specified, you must also supply a value of lambda arn in the `terminationPolicyCustomLambdaFunctionArn` property and
attach necessary [permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lambda-custom-termination-policy.html#lambda-custom-termination-policy-create-function)
to invoke the lambda function.

If there are multiple termination policies specified,
custom termination policy with lambda `TerminationPolicy.CUSTOM_LAMBDA_FUNCTION`
must be specified first.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage
# arn: str


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    termination_policies=[autoscaling.TerminationPolicy.CUSTOM_LAMBDA_FUNCTION, autoscaling.TerminationPolicy.OLDEST_INSTANCE, autoscaling.TerminationPolicy.DEFAULT
    ],

    # terminationPolicyCustomLambdaFunctionArn property must be specified if the TerminationPolicy.CUSTOM_LAMBDA_FUNCTION is used
    termination_policy_custom_lambda_function_arn=arn
)
```

## Protecting new instances from being terminated on scale-in

By default, Auto Scaling can terminate an instance at any time after launch when
scaling in an Auto Scaling Group, subject to the group's [termination
policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html).

However, you may wish to protect newly-launched instances from being scaled in
if they are going to run critical applications that should not be prematurely
terminated. EC2 Capacity Providers for Amazon ECS requires this attribute be
set to `true`.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    new_instances_protected_from_scale_in=True
)
```

## Configuring Capacity Rebalancing

Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. Otherwise, Capacity Rebalancing is disabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. For more information, see [Use Capacity Rebalancing to handle Amazon EC2 Spot Interruptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.html) in the in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    capacity_rebalance=True
)
```

## Connecting to your instances using SSM Session Manager

SSM Session Manager makes it possible to connect to your instances from the
AWS Console, without preparing SSH keys.

To do so, you need to:

* Use an image with [SSM agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) installed
  and configured. [Many images come with SSM Agent
  preinstalled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ami-preinstalled-agent.html), otherwise you
  may need to manually put instructions to [install SSM
  Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-manual-agent-install.html) into your
  instance's UserData or use EC2 Init).
* Create the AutoScalingGroup with `ssmSessionPermissions: true`.

If these conditions are met, you can connect to the instance from the EC2 Console. Example:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.T3, ec2.InstanceSize.MICRO),

    # Amazon Linux 2 comes with SSM Agent by default
    machine_image=ec2.MachineImage.latest_amazon_linux2(),

    # Turn on SSM
    ssm_session_permissions=True
)
```

## Configuring Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)

### Toggling IMDSv1

You can configure [EC2 Instance Metadata Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) options to either
allow both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2 or enforce IMDSv2 when interacting with the IMDS.

To do this for a single `AutoScalingGroup`, you can use set the `requireImdsv2` property.
The example below demonstrates IMDSv2 being required on a single `AutoScalingGroup`:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    require_imdsv2=True
)
```

You can also use `AutoScalingGroupRequireImdsv2Aspect` to apply the operation to multiple AutoScalingGroups.
The example below demonstrates the `AutoScalingGroupRequireImdsv2Aspect` being used to require IMDSv2 for all AutoScalingGroups in a stack:

```python
aspect = autoscaling.AutoScalingGroupRequireImdsv2Aspect()

Aspects.of(self).add(aspect)

## Warm Pool

Auto Scaling offers [a warm pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html) which gives an ability to decrease latency for applications that have exceptionally long boot times. You can create a warm pool with default parameters as below:

```python
# auto_scaling_group: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


auto_scaling_group.add_warm_pool()
```

You can also customize a warm pool by configuring parameters:

```python
# auto_scaling_group: autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup


auto_scaling_group.add_warm_pool(
    min_size=1,
    reuse_on_scale_in=True
)
```

### Default Instance Warming

You can use the default instance warmup feature to improve the Amazon CloudWatch metrics used for dynamic scaling.
When default instance warmup is not enabled, each instance starts contributing usage data to the aggregated metrics
as soon as the instance reaches the InService state. However, if you enable default instance warmup, this lets
your instances finish warming up before they contribute the usage data.

To optimize the performance of scaling policies that scale continuously, such as target tracking and step scaling
policies, we strongly recommend that you enable the default instance warmup, even if its value is set to 0 seconds.

To set up Default Instance Warming for an autoscaling group, simply pass it in as a prop

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    default_instance_warmup=Duration.seconds(5)
)
```

## Configuring KeyPair for instances

You can use a keyPair to build your asg when you decide not to use a ready-made LanchTemplate.

To configure KeyPair for an autoscaling group, pass the `keyPair` as a prop:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# instance_type: ec2.InstanceType
# machine_image: ec2.IMachineImage


my_key_pair = ec2.KeyPair(self, "MyKeyPair")

autoscaling.AutoScalingGroup(self, "ASG",
    vpc=vpc,
    instance_type=instance_type,
    machine_image=machine_image,

    # ...

    key_pair=my_key_pair
)
```

## Future work

* [ ] CloudWatch Events (impossible to add currently as the AutoScalingGroup ARN is
  necessary to make this rule and this cannot be accessed from CloudFormation).

        :param scope: Scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: Construct identifier for this resource (unique in its scope).
        :param max_size: The maximum size of the group. .. epigraph:: With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may need to go above ``MaxSize`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will never go above ``MaxSize`` by more than your largest instance weight (weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired capacity of the group).
        :param min_size: The minimum size of the group.
        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. The name can contain any ASCII character 33 to 126 including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters. .. epigraph:: You cannot use a colon (:) in the name.
        :param availability_zones: A list of Availability Zones where instances in the Auto Scaling group can be created. Used for launching into the default VPC subnet in each Availability Zone when not using the ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` property, or for attaching a network interface when an existing network interface ID is specified in a launch template.
        :param capacity_rebalance: Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. Otherwise, Capacity Rebalancing is disabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. For more information, see `Use Capacity Rebalancing to handle Amazon EC2 Spot Interruptions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.html>`_ in the in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param context: Reserved.
        :param cooldown: *Only needed if you use simple scaling policies.*. The amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending and another one starting due to simple scaling policies. For more information, see `Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default: ``300`` seconds
        :param default_instance_warmup: The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the ``InService`` state. During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage data. For more information, see `Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . .. epigraph:: To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, *even if it is set to 0 seconds* . To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify ``-1`` for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of ``0`` or other nominal value. Default: None
        :param desired_capacity: The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group at the time of its creation and the capacity it attempts to maintain. It can scale beyond this capacity if you configure automatic scaling. The number must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the group. If you do not specify a desired capacity when creating the stack, the default is the minimum size of the group. CloudFormation marks the Auto Scaling group as successful (by setting its status to CREATE_COMPLETE) when the desired capacity is reached. However, if a maximum Spot price is set in the launch template or launch configuration that you specified, then desired capacity is not used as a criteria for success. Whether your request is fulfilled depends on Spot Instance capacity and your maximum price.
        :param desired_capacity_type: The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports ``DesiredCapacityType`` for attribute-based instance type selection only. For more information, see `Create a mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type selection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-mixed-instances-group-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies ``units`` , which translates into number of instances. Valid values: ``units`` | ``vcpu`` | ``memory-mib``
        :param health_check_grace_period: The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health checks after they enter the ``InService`` state. For more information, see `Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/health-check-grace-period.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default: ``0`` seconds
        :param health_check_type: A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types. The valid values are ``EC2`` , ``ELB`` , and ``VPC_LATTICE`` . ``EC2`` is the default health check and cannot be disabled. For more information, see `Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Only specify ``EC2`` if you must clear a value that was previously set.
        :param instance_id: The ID of the instance used to base the launch configuration on. For more information, see `Create an Auto Scaling group using an EC2 instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-from-instance.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . If you specify ``LaunchTemplate`` , ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` , or ``LaunchConfigurationName`` , don't specify ``InstanceId`` .
        :param instance_maintenance_policy: An instance maintenance policy. For more information, see `Set instance maintenance policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param launch_configuration_name: The name of the launch configuration to use to launch instances. Required only if you don't specify ``LaunchTemplate`` , ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` , or ``InstanceId`` .
        :param launch_template: Information used to specify the launch template and version to use to launch instances. You can alternatively associate a launch template to the Auto Scaling group by specifying a ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` . For more information about creating launch templates, see `Create a launch template for an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . If you omit this property, you must specify ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` , ``LaunchConfigurationName`` , or ``InstanceId`` .
        :param lifecycle_hook_specification_list: One or more lifecycle hooks to add to the Auto Scaling group before instances are launched.
        :param load_balancer_names: A list of Classic Load Balancers associated with this Auto Scaling group. For Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancers, specify the ``TargetGroupARNs`` property instead.
        :param max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service. The default is null. If specified, the value must be either 0 or a number equal to or greater than 86,400 seconds (1 day). For more information, see `Replace Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-max-instance-lifetime.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param metrics_collection: Enables the monitoring of group metrics of an Auto Scaling group. By default, these metrics are disabled.
        :param mixed_instances_policy: An embedded object that specifies a mixed instances policy. The policy includes properties that not only define the distribution of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances, the maximum price to pay for Spot Instances (optional), and how the Auto Scaling group allocates instance types to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities, but also the properties that specify the instance configuration information—the launch template and instance types. The policy can also include a weight for each instance type and different launch templates for individual instance types. For more information, see `Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param new_instances_protected_from_scale_in: Indicates whether newly launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. For more information about preventing instances from terminating on scale in, see `Use instance scale-in protection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param notification_configuration: (deprecated) A structure that specifies an Amazon SNS notification configuration for the ``NotificationConfigurations`` property of the `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup.html>`_ resource. For an example template snippet, see `Auto scaling template snippets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-autoscaling.html>`_. For more information, see `Get Amazon SNS notifications when your Auto Scaling group scales <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ASGettingNotifications.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
        :param notification_configurations: Configures an Auto Scaling group to send notifications when specified events take place.
        :param placement_group: The name of the placement group into which to launch your instances. For more information, see `Placement groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . .. epigraph:: A *cluster* placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. You cannot specify multiple Availability Zones and a cluster placement group.
        :param service_linked_role_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service-linked role that the Auto Scaling group uses to call other AWS service on your behalf. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role named ``AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling`` , which it creates if it does not exist. For more information, see `Service-linked roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-service-linked-role.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param tags: One or more tags. You can tag your Auto Scaling group and propagate the tags to the Amazon EC2 instances it launches. Tags are not propagated to Amazon EBS volumes. To add tags to Amazon EBS volumes, specify the tags in a launch template but use caution. If the launch template specifies an instance tag with a key that is also specified for the Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling overrides the value of that instance tag with the value specified by the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see `Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-tagging.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param target_group_arns: The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target groups to associate with the Auto Scaling group. Instances are registered as targets with the target groups. The target groups receive incoming traffic and route requests to one or more registered targets. For more information, see `Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param termination_policies: A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instance to terminate. These policies are executed in the order that you list them. For more information, see `Configure termination policies for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-termination-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Valid values: ``Default`` | ``AllocationStrategy`` | ``ClosestToNextInstanceHour`` | ``NewestInstance`` | ``OldestInstance`` | ``OldestLaunchConfiguration`` | ``OldestLaunchTemplate`` | ``arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:my-function:my-alias``
        :param vpc_zone_identifier: A list of subnet IDs for a virtual private cloud (VPC) where instances in the Auto Scaling group can be created. If this resource specifies public subnets and is also in a VPC that is defined in the same stack template, you must use the `DependsOn attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html>`_ to declare a dependency on the `VPC-gateway attachment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpc-gateway-attachment.html>`_ . .. epigraph:: When you update ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` , this retains the same Auto Scaling group and replaces old instances with new ones, according to the specified subnets. You can optionally specify how CloudFormation handles these updates by using an `UpdatePolicy attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html>`_ . Required to launch instances into a nondefault VPC. If you specify ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` with ``AvailabilityZones`` , the subnets that you specify for this property must reside in those Availability Zones.

            '''The attributes for the instance types for a mixed instances policy.

            Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses your specified requirements to identify instance types. Then, it uses your On-Demand and Spot allocation strategies to launch instances from these instance types.

            When you specify multiple attributes, you get instance types that satisfy all of the specified attributes. If you specify multiple values for an attribute, you get instance types that satisfy any of the specified values.

            To limit the list of instance types from which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can identify matching instance types, you can use one of the following parameters, but not both in the same request:

            - ``AllowedInstanceTypes`` - The instance types to include in the list. All other instance types are ignored, even if they match your specified attributes.
            - ``ExcludedInstanceTypes`` - The instance types to exclude from the list, even if they match your specified attributes.

            .. epigraph::

               You must specify ``VCpuCount`` and ``MemoryMiB`` . All other attributes are optional. Any unspecified optional attribute is set to its default.

            For an example template, see `Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-ec2-auto-scaling.html>`_ .

            For more information, see `Creating an Auto Scaling group using attribute-based instance type selection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-instance-type-requirements.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . For help determining which instance types match your attributes before you apply them to your Auto Scaling group, see `Preview instance types with specified attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.html#ec2fleet-get-instance-types-from-instance-requirements>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .

Default: ``excluded``
            :param cpu_manufacturers: Lists which specific CPU manufacturers to include. - For instance types with Intel CPUs, specify ``intel`` . - For instance types with AMD CPUs, specify ``amd`` . - For instance types with AWS CPUs, specify ``amazon-web-services`` . .. epigraph:: Don't confuse the CPU hardware manufacturer with the CPU hardware architecture. Instances will be launched with a compatible CPU architecture based on the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that you specify in your launch template. Default: Any manufacturer
            :param excluded_instance_types: The instance types to exclude. You can use strings with one or more wild cards, represented by an asterisk ( ``*`` ), to exclude an instance family, type, size, or generation. The following are examples: ``m5.8xlarge`` , ``c5*.*`` , ``m5a.*`` , ``r*`` , ``*3*`` . For example, if you specify ``c5*`` , you are excluding the entire C5 instance family, which includes all C5a and C5n instance types. If you specify ``m5a.*`` , Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will exclude all the M5a instance types, but not the M5n instance types. .. epigraph:: If you specify ``ExcludedInstanceTypes`` , you can't specify ``AllowedInstanceTypes`` . Default: No excluded instance types
            :param instance_generations: Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are included. - For current generation instance types, specify ``current`` . The current generation includes EC2 instance types currently recommended for use. This typically includes the latest two to three generations in each instance family. For more information, see `Instance types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . - For previous generation instance types, specify ``previous`` . Default: Any current or previous generation
            :param local_storage: Indicates whether instance types with instance store volumes are included, excluded, or required. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 instance store <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . Default: ``included``
            :param local_storage_types: Indicates the type of local storage that is required. - For instance types with hard disk drive (HDD) storage, specify ``hdd`` . - For instance types with solid state drive (SSD) storage, specify ``ssd`` . Default: Any local storage type
            :param max_spot_price_as_percentage_of_optimal_on_demand_price: [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage of an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from either the lowest priced current generation instance types or, failing that, the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. If you set ``DesiredCapacityType`` to ``vcpu`` or ``memory-mib`` , the price protection threshold is based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per instance price. .. epigraph:: Only one of ``SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice`` or ``MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice`` can be specified. If you don't specify either, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will automatically apply optimal price protection to consistently select from a wide range of instance types. To indicate no price protection threshold for Spot Instances, meaning you want to consider all instance types that match your attributes, include one of these parameters and specify a high value, such as ``999999`` .
            :param memory_gib_per_v_cpu: The minimum and maximum amount of memory per vCPU for an instance type, in GiB. Default: No minimum or maximum limits

            :param on_demand_max_price_percentage_over_lowest_price: [Price protection] The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified On-Demand price. The identified On-Demand price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from either the lowest priced current generation instance types or, failing that, the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. To turn off price protection, specify a high value, such as ``999999`` . If you set ``DesiredCapacityType`` to ``vcpu`` or ``memory-mib`` , the price protection threshold is applied based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per instance price. Default: ``20``

            :param spot_max_price_percentage_over_lowest_price: [Price protection] The price protection threshold for Spot Instances, as a percentage higher than an identified Spot price. The identified Spot price is the price of the lowest priced current generation C, M, or R instance type with your specified attributes. If no current generation C, M, or R instance type matches your attributes, then the identified price is from either the lowest priced current generation instance types or, failing that, the lowest priced previous generation instance types that match your attributes. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling selects instance types with your attributes, we will exclude instance types whose price exceeds your specified threshold. The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling interprets as a percentage. If you set ``DesiredCapacityType`` to ``vcpu`` or ``memory-mib`` , the price protection threshold is based on the per-vCPU or per-memory price instead of the per instance price. .. epigraph:: Only one of ``SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice`` or ``MaxSpotPriceAsPercentageOfOptimalOnDemandPrice`` can be specified.

            :param on_demand_allocation_strategy: The allocation strategy to apply to your On-Demand Instances when they are launched. Possible instance types are determined by the launch template overrides that you specify. The following lists the valid values: - **lowest-price** - Uses price to determine which instance types are the highest priority, launching the lowest priced instance types within an Availability Zone first. This is the default value for Auto Scaling groups that specify ``InstanceRequirements`` . - **prioritized** - You set the order of instance types for the launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches your highest priority instance types first. If all your On-Demand capacity cannot be fulfilled using your highest priority instance type, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches the remaining capacity using the second priority instance type, and so on. This is the default value for Auto Scaling groups that don't specify ``InstanceRequirements`` and cannot be used for groups that do.
            :param on_demand_base_capacity: The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's capacity that must be fulfilled by On-Demand Instances. This base portion is launched first as your group scales. This number has the same unit of measurement as the group's desired capacity. If you change the default unit of measurement (number of instances) by specifying weighted capacity values in your launch template overrides list, or by changing the default desired capacity type setting of the group, you must specify this number using the same unit of measurement. Default: 0 .. epigraph:: An update to this setting means a gradual replacement of instances to adjust the current On-Demand Instance levels. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the previous ones.
            :param on_demand_percentage_above_base_capacity: Controls the percentages of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances for your additional capacity beyond ``OnDemandBaseCapacity`` . Expressed as a number (for example, 20 specifies 20% On-Demand Instances, 80% Spot Instances). If set to 100, only On-Demand Instances are used. Default: 100 .. epigraph:: An update to this setting means a gradual replacement of instances to adjust the current On-Demand and Spot Instance levels for your additional capacity higher than the base capacity. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the previous ones.
            :param spot_allocation_strategy: The allocation strategy to apply to your Spot Instances when they are launched. Possible instance types are determined by the launch template overrides that you specify. The following lists the valid values: - **capacity-optimized** - Requests Spot Instances using pools that are optimally chosen based on the available Spot capacity. This strategy has the lowest risk of interruption. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use ``capacity-optimized-prioritized`` . - **capacity-optimized-prioritized** - You set the order of instance types for the launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling honors the instance type priorities on a best effort basis but optimizes for capacity first. Note that if the On-Demand allocation strategy is set to ``prioritized`` , the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. This is not a valid value for Auto Scaling groups that specify ``InstanceRequirements`` . - **lowest-price** - Requests Spot Instances using the lowest priced pools within an Availability Zone, across the number of Spot pools that you specify for the ``SpotInstancePools`` property. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. This is the default value, but it might lead to high interruption rates because this strategy only considers instance price and not available capacity. - **price-capacity-optimized (recommended)** - The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price.
            :param spot_instance_pools: The number of Spot Instance pools across which to allocate your Spot Instances. The Spot pools are determined from the different instance types in the overrides. Valid only when the ``SpotAllocationStrategy`` is ``lowest-price`` . Value must be in the range of 1–20. Default: 2
            :param spot_max_price: The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. If your maximum price is lower than the Spot price for the instance types that you selected, your Spot Instances are not launched. We do not recommend specifying a maximum price because it can lead to increased interruptions. When Spot Instances launch, you pay the current Spot price. To remove a maximum price that you previously set, include the property but specify an empty string ("") for the value. .. epigraph:: If you specify a maximum price, your instances will be interrupted more frequently than if you do not specify one. Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.001

            The following lists the valid values:

            - **capacity-optimized** - Requests Spot Instances using pools that are optimally chosen based on the available Spot capacity. This strategy has the lowest risk of interruption. To give certain instance types a higher chance of launching first, use ``capacity-optimized-prioritized`` .
            - **capacity-optimized-prioritized** - You set the order of instance types for the launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling honors the instance type priorities on a best effort basis but optimizes for capacity first. Note that if the On-Demand allocation strategy is set to ``prioritized`` , the same priority is applied when fulfilling On-Demand capacity. This is not a valid value for Auto Scaling groups that specify ``InstanceRequirements`` .
            - **lowest-price** - Requests Spot Instances using the lowest priced pools within an Availability Zone, across the number of Spot pools that you specify for the ``SpotInstancePools`` property. To ensure that your desired capacity is met, you might receive Spot Instances from several pools. This is the default value, but it might lead to high interruption rates because this strategy only considers instance price and not available capacity.
            - **price-capacity-optimized (recommended)** - The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price.

You can specify up to 40 instance types per Auto Scaling group.
            :param launch_template_specification: Provides a launch template for the specified instance type or set of instance requirements. For example, some instance types might require a launch template with a different AMI.

For Auto Scaling groups, there are two major lifecycle transitions. - To create a lifecycle hook for scale-out events, specify ``autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING`` . - To create a lifecycle hook for scale-in events, specify ``autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING`` .
            :param default_result: The action the Auto Scaling group takes when the lifecycle hook timeout elapses or if an unexpected failure occurs. The default value is ``ABANDON`` . Valid values: ``CONTINUE`` | ``ABANDON``
            :param heartbeat_timeout: The maximum time, in seconds, that can elapse before the lifecycle hook times out. The range is from ``30`` to ``7200`` seconds. The default value is ``3600`` seconds (1 hour).
            :param notification_metadata: Additional information that you want to include any time Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling sends a message to the notification target.
            :param notification_target_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notification target that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling sends notifications to when an instance is in a wait state for the lifecycle hook. You can specify an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon SQS queue.

            You can create a mixed instances policy for new and existing Auto Scaling groups. You must use a launch template to configure the policy. You cannot use a launch configuration.

            There are key differences between Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances:

            - The price for Spot Instances varies based on demand
            - Amazon EC2 can terminate an individual Spot Instance as the availability of, or price for, Spot Instances changes

            When a Spot Instance is terminated, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group attempts to launch a replacement instance to maintain the desired capacity for the group.

            ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` is a property of the `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup.html>`_ resource.

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnAutoScalingGroup``.

        :param max_size: The maximum size of the group. .. epigraph:: With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may need to go above ``MaxSize`` to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will never go above ``MaxSize`` by more than your largest instance weight (weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired capacity of the group).
        :param min_size: The minimum size of the group.
        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. The name can contain any ASCII character 33 to 126 including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters. .. epigraph:: You cannot use a colon (:) in the name.
        :param availability_zones: A list of Availability Zones where instances in the Auto Scaling group can be created. Used for launching into the default VPC subnet in each Availability Zone when not using the ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` property, or for attaching a network interface when an existing network interface ID is specified in a launch template.
        :param capacity_rebalance: Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. Otherwise, Capacity Rebalancing is disabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. For more information, see `Use Capacity Rebalancing to handle Amazon EC2 Spot Interruptions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-capacity-rebalancing.html>`_ in the in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param context: Reserved.
        :param cooldown: *Only needed if you use simple scaling policies.*. The amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending and another one starting due to simple scaling policies. For more information, see `Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default: ``300`` seconds
        :param default_instance_warmup: The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the ``InService`` state. During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage data. For more information, see `Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-default-instance-warmup.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . .. epigraph:: To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, *even if it is set to 0 seconds* . To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify ``-1`` for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of ``0`` or other nominal value. Default: None
        :param desired_capacity: The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group at the time of its creation and the capacity it attempts to maintain. It can scale beyond this capacity if you configure automatic scaling. The number must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the group. If you do not specify a desired capacity when creating the stack, the default is the minimum size of the group. CloudFormation marks the Auto Scaling group as successful (by setting its status to CREATE_COMPLETE) when the desired capacity is reached. However, if a maximum Spot price is set in the launch template or launch configuration that you specified, then desired capacity is not used as a criteria for success. Whether your request is fulfilled depends on Spot Instance capacity and your maximum price.
        :param desired_capacity_type: The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports ``DesiredCapacityType`` for attribute-based instance type selection only. For more information, see `Create a mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type selection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-mixed-instances-group-attribute-based-instance-type-selection.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies ``units`` , which translates into number of instances. Valid values: ``units`` | ``vcpu`` | ``memory-mib``
        :param health_check_grace_period: The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health checks after they enter the ``InService`` state. For more information, see `Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/health-check-grace-period.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default: ``0`` seconds
        :param health_check_type: A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types. The valid values are ``EC2`` , ``ELB`` , and ``VPC_LATTICE`` . ``EC2`` is the default health check and cannot be disabled. For more information, see `Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-health-checks.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Only specify ``EC2`` if you must clear a value that was previously set.
        :param instance_id: The ID of the instance used to base the launch configuration on. For more information, see `Create an Auto Scaling group using an EC2 instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-asg-from-instance.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . If you specify ``LaunchTemplate`` , ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` , or ``LaunchConfigurationName`` , don't specify ``InstanceId`` .
        :param instance_maintenance_policy: An instance maintenance policy. For more information, see `Set instance maintenance policy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-maintenance-policy.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param launch_configuration_name: The name of the launch configuration to use to launch instances. Required only if you don't specify ``LaunchTemplate`` , ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` , or ``InstanceId`` .
        :param launch_template: Information used to specify the launch template and version to use to launch instances. You can alternatively associate a launch template to the Auto Scaling group by specifying a ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` . For more information about creating launch templates, see `Create a launch template for an Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . If you omit this property, you must specify ``MixedInstancesPolicy`` , ``LaunchConfigurationName`` , or ``InstanceId`` .
        :param lifecycle_hook_specification_list: One or more lifecycle hooks to add to the Auto Scaling group before instances are launched.
        :param load_balancer_names: A list of Classic Load Balancers associated with this Auto Scaling group. For Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancers, specify the ``TargetGroupARNs`` property instead.
        :param max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service. The default is null. If specified, the value must be either 0 or a number equal to or greater than 86,400 seconds (1 day). For more information, see `Replace Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-max-instance-lifetime.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param metrics_collection: Enables the monitoring of group metrics of an Auto Scaling group. By default, these metrics are disabled.
        :param mixed_instances_policy: An embedded object that specifies a mixed instances policy. The policy includes properties that not only define the distribution of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances, the maximum price to pay for Spot Instances (optional), and how the Auto Scaling group allocates instance types to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities, but also the properties that specify the instance configuration information—the launch template and instance types. The policy can also include a weight for each instance type and different launch templates for individual instance types. For more information, see `Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param new_instances_protected_from_scale_in: Indicates whether newly launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. For more information about preventing instances from terminating on scale in, see `Use instance scale-in protection <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-instance-protection.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param notification_configuration: (deprecated) A structure that specifies an Amazon SNS notification configuration for the ``NotificationConfigurations`` property of the `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-autoscaling-autoscalinggroup.html>`_ resource. For an example template snippet, see `Auto scaling template snippets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-autoscaling.html>`_. For more information, see `Get Amazon SNS notifications when your Auto Scaling group scales <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ASGettingNotifications.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.
        :param notification_configurations: Configures an Auto Scaling group to send notifications when specified events take place.
        :param placement_group: The name of the placement group into which to launch your instances. For more information, see `Placement groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . .. epigraph:: A *cluster* placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. You cannot specify multiple Availability Zones and a cluster placement group.
        :param service_linked_role_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service-linked role that the Auto Scaling group uses to call other AWS service on your behalf. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role named ``AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling`` , which it creates if it does not exist. For more information, see `Service-linked roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-service-linked-role.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param tags: One or more tags. You can tag your Auto Scaling group and propagate the tags to the Amazon EC2 instances it launches. Tags are not propagated to Amazon EBS volumes. To add tags to Amazon EBS volumes, specify the tags in a launch template but use caution. If the launch template specifies an instance tag with a key that is also specified for the Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling overrides the value of that instance tag with the value specified by the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see `Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-tagging.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param target_group_arns: The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target groups to associate with the Auto Scaling group. Instances are registered as targets with the target groups. The target groups receive incoming traffic and route requests to one or more registered targets. For more information, see `Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-load-balancer.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param termination_policies: A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instance to terminate. These policies are executed in the order that you list them. For more information, see `Configure termination policies for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-termination-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Valid values: ``Default`` | ``AllocationStrategy`` | ``ClosestToNextInstanceHour`` | ``NewestInstance`` | ``OldestInstance`` | ``OldestLaunchConfiguration`` | ``OldestLaunchTemplate`` | ``arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:my-function:my-alias``
        :param vpc_zone_identifier: A list of subnet IDs for a virtual private cloud (VPC) where instances in the Auto Scaling group can be created. If this resource specifies public subnets and is also in a VPC that is defined in the same stack template, you must use the `DependsOn attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-dependson.html>`_ to declare a dependency on the `VPC-gateway attachment <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpc-gateway-attachment.html>`_ . .. epigraph:: When you update ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` , this retains the same Auto Scaling group and replaces old instances with new ones, according to the specified subnets. You can optionally specify how CloudFormation handles these updates by using an `UpdatePolicy attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html>`_ . Required to launch instances into a nondefault VPC. If you specify ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` with ``AvailabilityZones`` , the subnets that you specify for this property must reside in those Availability Zones.

        :param placement_tenancy: The tenancy of the instance, either ``default`` or ``dedicated`` . An instance with ``dedicated`` tenancy runs on isolated, single-tenant hardware and can only be launched into a VPC. To launch dedicated instances into a shared tenancy VPC (a VPC with the instance placement tenancy attribute set to ``default`` ), you must set the value of this property to ``dedicated`` . If you specify ``PlacementTenancy`` , you must specify at least one subnet for ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` when you create your group. Valid values: ``default`` | ``dedicated``
        :param ram_disk_id: The ID of the RAM disk to select. .. epigraph:: We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks.

For ``gp3`` and ``io1`` volumes, this represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For ``gp2`` volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type: - ``gp3`` : 3,000-16,000 IOPS - ``io1`` : 100-64,000 IOPS For ``io1`` volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for `Instances built on the Nitro System <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#ec2-nitro-instances>`_ .

            :param throughput: The throughput (MiBps) to provision for a ``gp3`` volume.
            :param volume_size: The volume size, in GiBs. The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:. - ``gp2`` and ``gp3`` : 1-16,384 - ``io1`` : 4-16,384 - ``st1`` and ``sc1`` : 125-16,384 - ``standard`` : 1-1,024 You must specify either a ``SnapshotId`` or a ``VolumeSize`` .

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnLaunchConfiguration``.

        :param image_id: The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that was assigned during registration. For more information, see `Find a Linux AMI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . If you specify ``InstanceId`` , an ``ImageId`` is not required.
        :param instance_type: Specifies the instance type of the EC2 instance. For information about available instance types, see `Available instance types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#AvailableInstanceTypes>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . If you specify ``InstanceId`` , an ``InstanceType`` is not required.
        :param associate_public_ip_address: Specifies whether to assign a public IPv4 address to the group's instances. If the instance is launched into a default subnet, the default is to assign a public IPv4 address, unless you disabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address on the subnet. If the instance is launched into a nondefault subnet, the default is not to assign a public IPv4 address, unless you enabled the option to assign a public IPv4 address on the subnet. If you specify ``true`` , each instance in the Auto Scaling group receives a unique public IPv4 address. For more information, see `Provide network connectivity for your Auto Scaling instances using Amazon VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-in-vpc.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . If you specify this property, you must specify at least one subnet for ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` when you create your group.
        :param block_device_mappings: The block device mapping entries that define the block devices to attach to the instances at launch. By default, the block devices specified in the block device mapping for the AMI are used. For more information, see `Block device mappings <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .
        :param classic_link_vpc_id: Available for backward compatibility.
        :param classic_link_vpc_security_groups: Available for backward compatibility.
        :param ebs_optimized: Specifies whether the launch configuration is optimized for EBS I/O ( ``true`` ) or not ( ``false`` ). The optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal I/O performance. This optimization is not available with all instance types. Additional fees are incurred when you enable EBS optimization for an instance type that is not EBS-optimized by default. For more information, see `Amazon EBS-optimized instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* . The default value is ``false`` .
        :param iam_instance_profile: The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile associated with the IAM role for the instance. The instance profile contains the IAM role. For more information, see `IAM role for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/us-iam-role.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param instance_id: The ID of the Amazon EC2 instance to use to create the launch configuration. When you use an instance to create a launch configuration, all properties are derived from the instance with the exception of ``BlockDeviceMapping`` and ``AssociatePublicIpAddress`` . You can override any properties from the instance by specifying them in the launch configuration.
        :param instance_monitoring: Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed ( ``true`` ) or basic ( ``false`` ) monitoring. The default value is ``true`` (enabled). .. epigraph:: When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. For more information, see `Configure monitoring for Auto Scaling instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/enable-as-instance-metrics.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param kernel_id: The ID of the kernel associated with the AMI. .. epigraph:: We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see `User provided kernels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .
        :param key_name: The name of the key pair. For more information, see `Amazon EC2 key pairs and Amazon EC2 instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .
        :param launch_configuration_name: The name of the launch configuration. This name must be unique per Region per account.
        :param metadata_options: The metadata options for the instances. For more information, see `Configure the instance metadata options <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-config.html#launch-configurations-imds>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param placement_tenancy: The tenancy of the instance, either ``default`` or ``dedicated`` . An instance with ``dedicated`` tenancy runs on isolated, single-tenant hardware and can only be launched into a VPC. To launch dedicated instances into a shared tenancy VPC (a VPC with the instance placement tenancy attribute set to ``default`` ), you must set the value of this property to ``dedicated`` . If you specify ``PlacementTenancy`` , you must specify at least one subnet for ``VPCZoneIdentifier`` when you create your group. Valid values: ``default`` | ``dedicated``
        :param ram_disk_id: The ID of the RAM disk to select. .. epigraph:: We recommend that you use PV-GRUB instead of kernels and RAM disks. For more information, see `User provided kernels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .
        :param security_groups: A list that contains the security groups to assign to the instances in the Auto Scaling group. The list can contain both the IDs of existing security groups and references to `SecurityGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html>`_ resources created in the template. For more information, see `Control traffic to resources using security groups <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html>`_ in the *Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide* .
        :param spot_price: The maximum hourly price to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot price. For more information, see `Request Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible applications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-spot-instances.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Valid Range: Minimum value of 0.001 .. epigraph:: When you change your maximum price by creating a new launch configuration, running instances will continue to run as long as the maximum price for those running instances is higher than the current Spot price.
        :param user_data: The Base64-encoded user data to make available to the launched EC2 instances. For more information, see `Instance metadata and user data <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances* .

    These hooks let you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs. A lifecycle hook provides a specified amount of time (one hour by default) to wait for the action to complete before the instance transitions to the next state.

    Use lifecycle hooks to prepare new instances for use or to delay them from being registered behind a load balancer before their configuration has been applied completely. You can also use lifecycle hooks to prepare running instances to be terminated by, for example, downloading logs or other data.

        :param scope: Scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: Construct identifier for this resource (unique in its scope).
        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group.
        :param adjustment_type: Specifies how the scaling adjustment is interpreted (for example, an absolute number or a percentage). The valid values are ``ChangeInCapacity`` , ``ExactCapacity`` , and ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` . Required if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` or ``SimpleScaling`` . For more information, see `Scaling adjustment types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-adjustment>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param cooldown: A cooldown period, in seconds, that applies to a specific simple scaling policy. When a cooldown period is specified here, it overrides the default cooldown. Valid only if the policy type is ``SimpleScaling`` . For more information, see `Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default: None
        :param estimated_instance_warmup: *Not needed if the default instance warmup is defined for the group.*. The estimated time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the CloudWatch metrics. This warm-up period applies to instances launched due to a specific target tracking or step scaling policy. When a warm-up period is specified here, it overrides the default instance warmup. Valid only if the policy type is ``TargetTrackingScaling`` or ``StepScaling`` . .. epigraph:: The default is to use the value for the default instance warmup defined for the group. If default instance warmup is null, then ``EstimatedInstanceWarmup`` falls back to the value of default cooldown.
        :param metric_aggregation_type: The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. The valid values are ``Minimum`` , ``Maximum`` , and ``Average`` . If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as ``Average`` . Valid only if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` .
        :param min_adjustment_magnitude: The minimum value to scale by when the adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` . For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Auto Scaling group by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the group has 4 instances and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scales out the group by 2 instances. Valid only if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` or ``SimpleScaling`` . For more information, see `Scaling adjustment types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-adjustment>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . .. epigraph:: Some Auto Scaling groups use instance weights. In this case, set the ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` to a value that is at least as large as your largest instance weight.
        :param policy_type: One of the following policy types:. - ``TargetTrackingScaling`` - ``StepScaling`` - ``SimpleScaling`` (default) - ``PredictiveScaling``
        :param predictive_scaling_configuration: A predictive scaling policy. Provides support for predefined and custom metrics. Predefined metrics include CPU utilization, network in/out, and the Application Load Balancer request count. Required if the policy type is ``PredictiveScaling`` .
        :param scaling_adjustment: The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value adds to the current capacity while a negative number removes from the current capacity. For exact capacity, you must specify a non-negative value. Required if the policy type is ``SimpleScaling`` . (Not used with any other policy type.)
        :param step_adjustments: A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach. Required if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` . (Not used with any other policy type.)
        :param target_tracking_configuration: A target tracking scaling policy. Provides support for predefined or custom metrics. The following predefined metrics are available: - ``ASGAverageCPUUtilization`` - ``ASGAverageNetworkIn`` - ``ASGAverageNetworkOut`` - ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` If you specify ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` for the metric, you must specify the ``ResourceLabel`` property with the ``PredefinedMetricSpecification`` . Required if the policy type is ``TargetTrackingScaling`` .

            To create your customized metric specification:

            - Add values for each required property from CloudWatch. You can use an existing metric, or a new metric that you create. To use your own metric, you must first publish the metric to CloudWatch. For more information, see `Publish Custom Metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html>`_ in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide* .
            - Choose a metric that changes proportionally with capacity. The value of the metric should increase or decrease in inverse proportion to the number of capacity units. That is, the value of the metric should decrease when capacity increases.

            For more information about CloudWatch, see `Amazon CloudWatch Concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html>`_ .

            ``MetricDataQuery`` is a property of the following property types:

            - `AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy PredictiveScalingCustomizedScalingMetric <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-predictivescalingcustomizedscalingmetric.html>`_
            - `AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy PredictiveScalingCustomizedLoadMetric <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-predictivescalingcustomizedloadmetric.html>`_
            - `AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy PredictiveScalingCustomizedCapacityMetric <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-autoscaling-scalingpolicy-predictivescalingcustomizedcapacitymetric.html>`_

            Predictive scaling uses the time series data received from CloudWatch to understand how to schedule capacity based on your historical workload patterns.

            You can call for a single metric or perform math expressions on multiple metrics. Any expressions used in a metric specification must eventually return a single time series.

            For more information and examples, see `Advanced predictive scaling policy configurations using custom metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/predictive-scaling-customized-metric-specification.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .

            :param id: A short name that identifies the object's results in the response. This name must be unique among all ``MetricDataQuery`` objects specified for a single scaling policy. If you are performing math expressions on this set of data, this name represents that data and can serve as a variable in the mathematical expression. The valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscores. The first character must be a lowercase letter.
            :param expression: The math expression to perform on the returned data, if this object is performing a math expression. This expression can use the ``Id`` of the other metrics to refer to those metrics, and can also use the ``Id`` of other expressions to use the result of those expressions. Conditional: Within each ``MetricDataQuery`` object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` , but not both.
            :param label: A human-readable label for this metric or expression. This is especially useful if this is a math expression, so that you know what the value represents.
            :param metric_stat: Information about the metric data to return. Conditional: Within each ``MetricDataQuery`` object, you must specify either ``Expression`` or ``MetricStat`` , but not both.
            :param return_data: Indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric. If you use any math expressions, specify ``true`` for this value for only the final math expression that the metric specification is based on. You must specify ``false`` for ``ReturnData`` for all the other metrics and expressions used in the metric specification. If you are only retrieving metrics and not performing any math expressions, do not specify anything for ``ReturnData`` . This sets it to its default ( ``true`` ).

            For more information, see `Predictive scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-predictive-scaling.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .

            :param metric_specifications: This structure includes the metrics and target utilization to use for predictive scaling. This is an array, but we currently only support a single metric specification. That is, you can specify a target value and a single metric pair, or a target value and one scaling metric and one load metric.
            :param max_capacity_breach_behavior: Defines the behavior that should be applied if the forecast capacity approaches or exceeds the maximum capacity of the Auto Scaling group. Defaults to ``HonorMaxCapacity`` if not specified. The following are possible values: - ``HonorMaxCapacity`` - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can't increase the maximum capacity of the group when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. - ``IncreaseMaxCapacity`` - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can increase the maximum capacity of the group when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The upper limit is determined by the forecasted capacity and the value for ``MaxCapacityBuffer`` . .. epigraph:: Use caution when allowing the maximum capacity to be automatically increased. This can lead to more instances being launched than intended if the increased maximum capacity is not monitored and managed. The increased maximum capacity then becomes the new normal maximum capacity for the Auto Scaling group until you manually update it. The maximum capacity does not automatically decrease back to the original maximum.
            :param max_capacity_buffer: The size of the capacity buffer to use when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The value is specified as a percentage relative to the forecast capacity. For example, if the buffer is 10, this means a 10 percent buffer, such that if the forecast capacity is 50, and the maximum capacity is 40, then the effective maximum capacity is 55. If set to 0, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may scale capacity higher than the maximum capacity to equal but not exceed forecast capacity. Required if the ``MaxCapacityBreachBehavior`` property is set to ``IncreaseMaxCapacity`` , and cannot be used otherwise.
            :param mode: The predictive scaling mode. Defaults to ``ForecastOnly`` if not specified.
            :param scheduling_buffer_time: The amount of time, in seconds, by which the instance launch time can be advanced. For example, the forecast says to add capacity at 10:00 AM, and you choose to pre-launch instances by 5 minutes. In that case, the instances will be launched at 9:55 AM. The intention is to give resources time to be provisioned. It can take a few minutes to launch an EC2 instance. The actual amount of time required depends on several factors, such as the size of the instance and whether there are startup scripts to complete. The value must be less than the forecast interval duration of 3600 seconds (60 minutes). Defaults to 300 seconds if not specified.

            - ``HonorMaxCapacity`` - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can't increase the maximum capacity of the group when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity.
            - ``IncreaseMaxCapacity`` - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can increase the maximum capacity of the group when the forecast capacity is close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The upper limit is determined by the forecasted capacity and the value for ``MaxCapacityBuffer`` .

            You must specify either a metric pair, or a load metric and a scaling metric individually. Specifying a metric pair instead of individual metrics provides a simpler way to configure metrics for a scaling policy. You choose the metric pair, and the policy automatically knows the correct sum and average statistics to use for the load metric and the scaling metric.

            Example

            - You create a predictive scaling policy and specify ``ALBRequestCount`` as the value for the metric pair and ``1000.0`` as the target value. For this type of metric, you must provide the metric dimension for the corresponding target group, so you also provide a resource label for the Application Load Balancer target group that is attached to your Auto Scaling group.
            - The number of requests the target group receives per minute provides the load metric, and the request count averaged between the members of the target group provides the scaling metric. In CloudWatch, this refers to the ``RequestCount`` and ``RequestCountPerTarget`` metrics, respectively.
            - For optimal use of predictive scaling, you adhere to the best practice of using a dynamic scaling policy to automatically scale between the minimum capacity and maximum capacity in response to real-time changes in resource utilization.
            - Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling consumes data points for the load metric over the last 14 days and creates an hourly load forecast for predictive scaling. (A minimum of 24 hours of data is required.)
            - After creating the load forecast, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling determines when to reduce or increase the capacity of your Auto Scaling group in each hour of the forecast period so that the average number of requests received by each instance is as close to 1000 requests per minute as possible at all times.

            For information about using custom metrics with predictive scaling, see `Advanced predictive scaling policy configurations using custom metrics <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/predictive-scaling-customized-metric-specification.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .

            :param target_value: Specifies the target utilization. .. epigraph:: Some metrics are based on a count instead of a percentage, such as the request count for an Application Load Balancer or the number of messages in an SQS queue. If the scaling policy specifies one of these metrics, specify the target utilization as the optimal average request or message count per instance during any one-minute interval.
            :param customized_capacity_metric_specification: The customized capacity metric specification.
            :param customized_load_metric_specification: The customized load metric specification.

            For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:

            - To trigger a step adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.
            - To trigger a step adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.

            There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:

            - The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.
            - At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.
            - At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.
            - The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.

            For more information, see `Step adjustments <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-steps>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .

            You can find a sample template snippet in the `Examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-autoscaling-scalingpolicy.html#aws-resource-autoscaling-scalingpolicy--examples>`_ section of the ``AWS::AutoScaling::ScalingPolicy`` resource.

            :param scaling_adjustment: The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value adds to the current capacity while a negative number removes from the current capacity. For exact capacity, you must specify a non-negative value.
            :param metric_interval_lower_bound: The lower bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclusive (the metric must be greater than or equal to the threshold plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it is exclusive (the metric must be greater than the threshold plus the lower bound). A null value indicates negative infinity.
            :param metric_interval_upper_bound: The upper bound for the difference between the alarm threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric value is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is exclusive (the metric must be less than the threshold plus the upper bound).

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnScalingPolicy``.

        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group.
        :param adjustment_type: Specifies how the scaling adjustment is interpreted (for example, an absolute number or a percentage). The valid values are ``ChangeInCapacity`` , ``ExactCapacity`` , and ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` . Required if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` or ``SimpleScaling`` . For more information, see `Scaling adjustment types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-adjustment>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
        :param cooldown: A cooldown period, in seconds, that applies to a specific simple scaling policy. When a cooldown period is specified here, it overrides the default cooldown. Valid only if the policy type is ``SimpleScaling`` . For more information, see `Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . Default: None
        :param estimated_instance_warmup: *Not needed if the default instance warmup is defined for the group.*. The estimated time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the CloudWatch metrics. This warm-up period applies to instances launched due to a specific target tracking or step scaling policy. When a warm-up period is specified here, it overrides the default instance warmup. Valid only if the policy type is ``TargetTrackingScaling`` or ``StepScaling`` . .. epigraph:: The default is to use the value for the default instance warmup defined for the group. If default instance warmup is null, then ``EstimatedInstanceWarmup`` falls back to the value of default cooldown.
        :param metric_aggregation_type: The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. The valid values are ``Minimum`` , ``Maximum`` , and ``Average`` . If the aggregation type is null, the value is treated as ``Average`` . Valid only if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` .
        :param min_adjustment_magnitude: The minimum value to scale by when the adjustment type is ``PercentChangeInCapacity`` . For example, suppose that you create a step scaling policy to scale out an Auto Scaling group by 25 percent and you specify a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2. If the group has 4 instances and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` of 2, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scales out the group by 2 instances. Valid only if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` or ``SimpleScaling`` . For more information, see `Scaling adjustment types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-adjustment>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* . .. epigraph:: Some Auto Scaling groups use instance weights. In this case, set the ``MinAdjustmentMagnitude`` to a value that is at least as large as your largest instance weight.
        :param policy_type: One of the following policy types:. - ``TargetTrackingScaling`` - ``StepScaling`` - ``SimpleScaling`` (default) - ``PredictiveScaling``
        :param predictive_scaling_configuration: A predictive scaling policy. Provides support for predefined and custom metrics. Predefined metrics include CPU utilization, network in/out, and the Application Load Balancer request count. Required if the policy type is ``PredictiveScaling`` .
        :param scaling_adjustment: The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A positive value adds to the current capacity while a negative number removes from the current capacity. For exact capacity, you must specify a non-negative value. Required if the policy type is ``SimpleScaling`` . (Not used with any other policy type.)
        :param step_adjustments: A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the alarm breach. Required if the policy type is ``StepScaling`` . (Not used with any other policy type.)
        :param target_tracking_configuration: A target tracking scaling policy. Provides support for predefined or custom metrics. The following predefined metrics are available: - ``ASGAverageCPUUtilization`` - ``ASGAverageNetworkIn`` - ``ASGAverageNetworkOut`` - ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` If you specify ``ALBRequestCountPerTarget`` for the metric, you must specify the ``ResourceLabel`` property with the ``PredefinedMetricSpecification`` . Required if the policy type is ``TargetTrackingScaling`` .

    '''The ``AWS::AutoScaling::ScheduledAction`` resource specifies an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling scheduled action so that the Auto Scaling group can change the number of instances available for your application in response to predictable load changes.

    When you update a stack with an Auto Scaling group and scheduled action, CloudFormation always sets the min size, max size, and desired capacity properties of your group to the values that are defined in the ``AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup`` section of your template. However, you might not want CloudFormation to do that when you have a scheduled action in effect. You can use an `UpdatePolicy attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html>`_ to prevent CloudFormation from changing the min size, max size, or desired capacity property values during a stack update unless you modified the individual values in your template. If you have rolling updates enabled, before you can update the Auto Scaling group, you must suspend scheduled actions by specifying an `UpdatePolicy attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html>`_ for the Auto Scaling group. You can find a sample update policy for rolling updates in `Configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-ec2-auto-scaling.html>`_ .

    '''The ``AWS::AutoScaling::WarmPool`` resource creates a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that sits alongside the Auto Scaling group.

    Whenever your application needs to scale out, the Auto Scaling group can draw on the warm pool to meet its new desired capacity.

    When you create a warm pool, you can define a minimum size. When your Auto Scaling group scales out and the size of the warm pool shrinks, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances into the warm pool to maintain its minimum size.

    For more information, see `Warm pools for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide* .
    .. epigraph::

       CloudFormation supports the ``UpdatePolicy`` attribute for Auto Scaling groups. During an update, if ``UpdatePolicy`` is set to ``AutoScalingRollingUpdate`` , CloudFormation replaces ``InService`` instances only. Instances in the warm pool are not replaced. The difference in which instances are replaced can potentially result in different instance configurations after the stack update completes. If ``UpdatePolicy`` is set to ``AutoScalingReplacingUpdate`` , you do not encounter this issue because CloudFormation replaces both the Auto Scaling group and the warm pool.

        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. Default: - Auto generated by CloudFormation
        :param block_devices: Specifies how block devices are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes. Each instance that is launched has an associated root device volume, either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume.

This delay lets an instance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates instance metrics, resulting in more reliable usage data. Set this value equal to the amount of time that it takes for resource consumption to become stable after an instance reaches the InService state. To optimize the performance of scaling policies that scale continuously, such as target tracking and step scaling policies, we strongly recommend that you enable the default instance warmup, even if its value is set to 0 seconds Default instance warmup will not be added if no value is specified Default: None
        :param desired_capacity: Initial amount of instances in the fleet. If this is set to a number, every deployment will reset the amount of instances to this number. It is recommended to leave this value blank. Default: minCapacity, and leave unchanged during deployment
        :param group_metrics: Enable monitoring for group metrics, these metrics describe the group rather than any of its instances. To report all group metrics use ``GroupMetrics.all()`` Group metrics are reported in a granularity of 1 minute at no additional charge. Default: - no group metrics will be reported
        :param health_check: Configuration for health checks. Default: - HealthCheck.ec2 with no grace period
        :param ignore_unmodified_size_properties: If the ASG has scheduled actions, don't reset unchanged group sizes. Only used if the ASG has scheduled actions (which may scale your ASG up or down regardless of cdk deployments). If true, the size of the group will only be reset if it has been changed in the CDK app. If false, the sizes will always be changed back to what they were in the CDK app on deployment. Default: true
        :param instance_monitoring: Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed or basic monitoring. When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Monitoring.DETAILED
        :param key_name: (deprecated) Name of SSH keypair to grant access to instances. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified You can either specify ``keyPair`` or ``keyName``, not both. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param key_pair: The SSH keypair to grant access to the instance. Feature flag ``AUTOSCALING_GENERATE_LAUNCH_TEMPLATE`` must be enabled to use this property. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified. You can either specify ``keyPair`` or ``keyName``, not both. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param max_capacity: Maximum number of instances in the fleet. Default: desiredCapacity
        :param max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time that an instance can be in service. The maximum duration applies to all current and future instances in the group. As an instance approaches its maximum duration, it is terminated and replaced, and cannot be used again. You must specify a value of at least 604,800 seconds (7 days). To clear a previously set value, leave this property undefined. Default: none
        :param min_capacity: Minimum number of instances in the fleet. Default: 1
        :param new_instances_protected_from_scale_in: Whether newly-launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. By default, Auto Scaling can terminate an instance at any time after launch when scaling in an Auto Scaling Group, subject to the group's termination policy. However, you may wish to protect newly-launched instances from being scaled in if they are going to run critical applications that should not be prematurely terminated. This flag must be enabled if the Auto Scaling Group will be associated with an ECS Capacity Provider with managed termination protection. Default: false
        :param notifications: Configure autoscaling group to send notifications about fleet changes to an SNS topic(s). Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param signals: Configure waiting for signals during deployment. Use this to pause the CloudFormation deployment to wait for the instances in the AutoScalingGroup to report successful startup during creation and updates. The UserData script needs to invoke ``cfn-signal`` with a success or failure code after it is done setting up the instance. Without waiting for signals, the CloudFormation deployment will proceed as soon as the AutoScalingGroup has been created or updated but before the instances in the group have been started. For example, to have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script. For an example, see the verify_instance_health command in the Auto Scaling rolling updates sample template: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/blob/master/aws/services/AutoScaling/AutoScalingRollingUpdates.yaml Default: - Do not wait for signals
        :param spot_price: The maximum hourly price (in USD) to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot market price. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: none
        :param ssm_session_permissions: Add SSM session permissions to the instance role. Setting this to ``true`` adds the necessary permissions to connect to the instance using SSM Session Manager. You can do this from the AWS Console. NOTE: Setting this flag to ``true`` may not be enough by itself. You must also use an AMI that comes with the SSM Agent, or install the SSM Agent yourself. See `Working with SSM Agent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html>`_ in the SSM Developer Guide. Default: false
        :param termination_policies: A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instances to terminate. The policies are executed in the order that you list them. Default: - ``TerminationPolicy.DEFAULT``
        :param termination_policy_custom_lambda_function_arn: A lambda function Arn that can be used as a custom termination policy to select the instances to terminate. This property must be specified if the TerminationPolicy.CUSTOM_LAMBDA_FUNCTION is used. Default: - No lambda function Arn will be supplied
        :param update_policy: What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config. Default: - ``UpdatePolicy.rollingUpdate()`` if using ``init``, ``UpdatePolicy.none()`` otherwise
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place instances within the VPC. Default: - All Private subnets.

        instance types to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities.

        :param on_demand_base_capacity: The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's capacity that must be fulfilled by On-Demand Instances. This base portion is provisioned first as your group scales. Defaults to 0 if not specified. If you specify weights for the instance types in the overrides, set the value of OnDemandBaseCapacity in terms of the number of capacity units, and not the number of instances. Default: 0
        :param on_demand_percentage_above_base_capacity: Controls the percentages of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances for your additional capacity beyond OnDemandBaseCapacity. Expressed as a number (for example, 20 specifies 20% On-Demand Instances, 80% Spot Instances). Defaults to 100 if not specified. If set to 100, only On-Demand Instances are provisioned. Default: 100
        :param spot_allocation_strategy: If the allocation strategy is lowest-price, the Auto Scaling group launches instances using the Spot pools with the lowest price, and evenly allocates your instances across the number of Spot pools that you specify. Defaults to lowest-price if not specified. If the allocation strategy is capacity-optimized (recommended), the Auto Scaling group launches instances using Spot pools that are optimally chosen based on the available Spot capacity. Alternatively, you can use capacity-optimized-prioritized and set the order of instance types in the list of launch template overrides from highest to lowest priority (from first to last in the list). Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling honors the instance type priorities on a best-effort basis but optimizes for capacity first. Default: SpotAllocationStrategy.LOWEST_PRICE
        :param spot_instance_pools: The number of Spot Instance pools to use to allocate your Spot capacity. The Spot pools are determined from the different instance types in the overrides. Valid only when the Spot allocation strategy is lowest-price. Value must be in the range of 1 to 20. Defaults to 2 if not specified. Default: 2
        :param spot_max_price: The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. If you leave the value at its default (empty), Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the On-Demand price as the maximum Spot price. To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify an empty string ("") for the value. Default: "" - On-Demand price

It represents the maximum percentage of the group that can be in service and healthy, or pending, to support your workload when replacing instances. Value range is 0 to 100. After it's set, both ``minHealthyPercentage`` and ``maxHealthyPercentage`` to -1 will clear the previously set value. Both or neither of ``minHealthyPercentage`` and ``maxHealthyPercentage`` must be specified, and the difference between them cannot be greater than 100. A large range increases the number of instances that can be replaced at the same time. Default: - No instance maintenance policy.
        :param min_healthy_percentage: Specifies the lower threshold as a percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. It represents the minimum percentage of the group to keep in service, healthy, and ready to use to support your workload when replacing instances. Value range is 0 to 100. After it's set, both ``minHealthyPercentage`` and ``maxHealthyPercentage`` to -1 will clear the previously set value.

        :param require_imdsv2: Whether IMDSv2 should be required on launched instances. Default: false
        :param role: An IAM role to associate with the instance profile assigned to this Auto Scaling Group. The role must be assumable by the service principal ``ec2.amazonaws.com``: ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: A role will automatically be created, it can be accessed via the ``role`` property
        :param security_group: Security group to launch the instances in. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - A SecurityGroup will be created if none is specified.
        :param user_data: Specific UserData to use. The UserData may still be mutated after creation. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - A UserData object appropriate for the MachineImage's Operating System is created.
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether the instances can initiate connections to anywhere by default. Default: true
        :param associate_public_ip_address: Whether instances in the Auto Scaling Group should have public IP addresses associated with them. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Use subnet setting.
        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. Default: - Auto generated by CloudFormation
        :param block_devices: Specifies how block devices are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes. Each instance that is launched has an associated root device volume, either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume. You can use block device mappings to specify additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it is launched. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Uses the block device mapping of the AMI
        :param capacity_rebalance: Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. Default: false
        :param cooldown: Default scaling cooldown for this AutoScalingGroup. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param default_instance_warmup: The amount of time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. This delay lets an instance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates instance metrics, resulting in more reliable usage data. Set this value equal to the amount of time that it takes for resource consumption to become stable after an instance reaches the InService state. To optimize the performance of scaling policies that scale continuously, such as target tracking and step scaling policies, we strongly recommend that you enable the default instance warmup, even if its value is set to 0 seconds Default instance warmup will not be added if no value is specified Default: None
        :param desired_capacity: Initial amount of instances in the fleet. If this is set to a number, every deployment will reset the amount of instances to this number. It is recommended to leave this value blank. Default: minCapacity, and leave unchanged during deployment
        :param group_metrics: Enable monitoring for group metrics, these metrics describe the group rather than any of its instances. To report all group metrics use ``GroupMetrics.all()`` Group metrics are reported in a granularity of 1 minute at no additional charge. Default: - no group metrics will be reported
        :param health_check: Configuration for health checks. Default: - HealthCheck.ec2 with no grace period
        :param ignore_unmodified_size_properties: If the ASG has scheduled actions, don't reset unchanged group sizes. Only used if the ASG has scheduled actions (which may scale your ASG up or down regardless of cdk deployments). If true, the size of the group will only be reset if it has been changed in the CDK app. If false, the sizes will always be changed back to what they were in the CDK app on deployment. Default: true
        :param instance_monitoring: Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed or basic monitoring. When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Monitoring.DETAILED
        :param key_name: (deprecated) Name of SSH keypair to grant access to instances. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified You can either specify ``keyPair`` or ``keyName``, not both. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param key_pair: The SSH keypair to grant access to the instance. Feature flag ``AUTOSCALING_GENERATE_LAUNCH_TEMPLATE`` must be enabled to use this property. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified. You can either specify ``keyPair`` or ``keyName``, not both. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param max_capacity: Maximum number of instances in the fleet. Default: desiredCapacity
        :param max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time that an instance can be in service. The maximum duration applies to all current and future instances in the group. As an instance approaches its maximum duration, it is terminated and replaced, and cannot be used again. You must specify a value of at least 604,800 seconds (7 days). To clear a previously set value, leave this property undefined. Default: none
        :param min_capacity: Minimum number of instances in the fleet. Default: 1
        :param new_instances_protected_from_scale_in: Whether newly-launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. By default, Auto Scaling can terminate an instance at any time after launch when scaling in an Auto Scaling Group, subject to the group's termination policy. However, you may wish to protect newly-launched instances from being scaled in if they are going to run critical applications that should not be prematurely terminated. This flag must be enabled if the Auto Scaling Group will be associated with an ECS Capacity Provider with managed termination protection. Default: false
        :param notifications: Configure autoscaling group to send notifications about fleet changes to an SNS topic(s). Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param signals: Configure waiting for signals during deployment. Use this to pause the CloudFormation deployment to wait for the instances in the AutoScalingGroup to report successful startup during creation and updates. The UserData script needs to invoke ``cfn-signal`` with a success or failure code after it is done setting up the instance. Without waiting for signals, the CloudFormation deployment will proceed as soon as the AutoScalingGroup has been created or updated but before the instances in the group have been started. For example, to have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script. For an example, see the verify_instance_health command in the Auto Scaling rolling updates sample template: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/blob/master/aws/services/AutoScaling/AutoScalingRollingUpdates.yaml Default: - Do not wait for signals
        :param spot_price: The maximum hourly price (in USD) to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot market price. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: none
        :param ssm_session_permissions: Add SSM session permissions to the instance role. Setting this to ``true`` adds the necessary permissions to connect to the instance using SSM Session Manager. You can do this from the AWS Console. NOTE: Setting this flag to ``true`` may not be enough by itself. You must also use an AMI that comes with the SSM Agent, or install the SSM Agent yourself. See `Working with SSM Agent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html>`_ in the SSM Developer Guide. Default: false
        :param termination_policies: A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instances to terminate. The policies are executed in the order that you list them. Default: - ``TerminationPolicy.DEFAULT``
        :param termination_policy_custom_lambda_function_arn: A lambda function Arn that can be used as a custom termination policy to select the instances to terminate. This property must be specified if the TerminationPolicy.CUSTOM_LAMBDA_FUNCTION is used. Default: - No lambda function Arn will be supplied
        :param update_policy: What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config.

        :param adjustment_type: How the adjustment numbers inside 'intervals' are interpreted. Default: ChangeInCapacity
        :param cooldown: Grace period after scaling activity. Default: Default cooldown period on your AutoScalingGroup
        :param datapoints_to_alarm: The number of data points out of the evaluation periods that must be breaching to trigger a scaling action. Creates an "M out of N" alarm, where this property is the M and the value set for ``evaluationPeriods`` is the N value. Only has meaning if ``evaluationPeriods != 1``. Must be less than or equal to ``evaluationPeriods``. Default: - Same as ``evaluationPeriods``
        :param estimated_instance_warmup: Estimated time until a newly launched instance can send metrics to CloudWatch. Default: Same as the cooldown
        :param evaluation_periods: How many evaluation periods of the metric to wait before triggering a scaling action. Raising this value can be used to smooth out the metric, at the expense of slower response times. If ``datapointsToAlarm`` is not set, then all data points in the evaluation period must meet the criteria to trigger a scaling action. Default: 1
        :param metric_aggregation_type: Aggregation to apply to all data points over the evaluation periods. Only has meaning if ``evaluationPeriods != 1``. Default: - The statistic from the metric if applicable (MIN, MAX, AVERAGE), otherwise AVERAGE.
        :param min_adjustment_magnitude: Minimum absolute number to adjust capacity with as result of percentage scaling. Only when using AdjustmentType = PercentChangeInCapacity, this number controls the minimum absolute effect size. Default: No minimum scaling effect

        '''Properties of a Fleet.

        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether the instances can initiate connections to anywhere by default. Default: true
        :param associate_public_ip_address: Whether instances in the Auto Scaling Group should have public IP addresses associated with them. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Use subnet setting.
        :param auto_scaling_group_name: The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. Default: - Auto generated by CloudFormation
        :param block_devices: Specifies how block devices are exposed to the instance. You can specify virtual devices and EBS volumes. Each instance that is launched has an associated root device volume, either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume. You can use block device mappings to specify additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it is launched. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Uses the block device mapping of the AMI
        :param capacity_rebalance: Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. Default: false
        :param cooldown: Default scaling cooldown for this AutoScalingGroup. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param default_instance_warmup: The amount of time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can contribute to the Amazon CloudWatch metrics. This delay lets an instance finish initializing before Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling aggregates instance metrics, resulting in more reliable usage data. Set this value equal to the amount of time that it takes for resource consumption to become stable after an instance reaches the InService state. To optimize the performance of scaling policies that scale continuously, such as target tracking and step scaling policies, we strongly recommend that you enable the default instance warmup, even if its value is set to 0 seconds Default instance warmup will not be added if no value is specified Default: None
        :param desired_capacity: Initial amount of instances in the fleet. If this is set to a number, every deployment will reset the amount of instances to this number. It is recommended to leave this value blank. Default: minCapacity, and leave unchanged during deployment
        :param group_metrics: Enable monitoring for group metrics, these metrics describe the group rather than any of its instances. To report all group metrics use ``GroupMetrics.all()`` Group metrics are reported in a granularity of 1 minute at no additional charge. Default: - no group metrics will be reported
        :param health_check: Configuration for health checks. Default: - HealthCheck.ec2 with no grace period
        :param ignore_unmodified_size_properties: If the ASG has scheduled actions, don't reset unchanged group sizes. Only used if the ASG has scheduled actions (which may scale your ASG up or down regardless of cdk deployments). If true, the size of the group will only be reset if it has been changed in the CDK app. If false, the sizes will always be changed back to what they were in the CDK app on deployment. Default: true
        :param instance_monitoring: Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed or basic monitoring. When detailed monitoring is enabled, Amazon CloudWatch generates metrics every minute and your account is charged a fee. When you disable detailed monitoring, CloudWatch generates metrics every 5 minutes. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Monitoring.DETAILED
        :param key_name: (deprecated) Name of SSH keypair to grant access to instances. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified You can either specify ``keyPair`` or ``keyName``, not both. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param key_pair: The SSH keypair to grant access to the instance. Feature flag ``AUTOSCALING_GENERATE_LAUNCH_TEMPLATE`` must be enabled to use this property. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified. You can either specify ``keyPair`` or ``keyName``, not both. Default: - No SSH access will be possible.
        :param max_capacity: Maximum number of instances in the fleet. Default: desiredCapacity
        :param max_instance_lifetime: The maximum amount of time that an instance can be in service. The maximum duration applies to all current and future instances in the group. As an instance approaches its maximum duration, it is terminated and replaced, and cannot be used again. You must specify a value of at least 604,800 seconds (7 days). To clear a previously set value, leave this property undefined. Default: none
        :param min_capacity: Minimum number of instances in the fleet. Default: 1
        :param new_instances_protected_from_scale_in: Whether newly-launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. By default, Auto Scaling can terminate an instance at any time after launch when scaling in an Auto Scaling Group, subject to the group's termination policy. However, you may wish to protect newly-launched instances from being scaled in if they are going to run critical applications that should not be prematurely terminated. This flag must be enabled if the Auto Scaling Group will be associated with an ECS Capacity Provider with managed termination protection. Default: false
        :param notifications: Configure autoscaling group to send notifications about fleet changes to an SNS topic(s). Default: - No fleet change notifications will be sent.
        :param signals: Configure waiting for signals during deployment. Use this to pause the CloudFormation deployment to wait for the instances in the AutoScalingGroup to report successful startup during creation and updates. The UserData script needs to invoke ``cfn-signal`` with a success or failure code after it is done setting up the instance. Without waiting for signals, the CloudFormation deployment will proceed as soon as the AutoScalingGroup has been created or updated but before the instances in the group have been started. For example, to have instances wait for an Elastic Load Balancing health check before they signal success, add a health-check verification by using the cfn-init helper script. For an example, see the verify_instance_health command in the Auto Scaling rolling updates sample template: https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates/blob/master/aws/services/AutoScaling/AutoScalingRollingUpdates.yaml Default: - Do not wait for signals
        :param spot_price: The maximum hourly price (in USD) to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you specify exceeds the current Spot market price. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: none
        :param ssm_session_permissions: Add SSM session permissions to the instance role. Setting this to ``true`` adds the necessary permissions to connect to the instance using SSM Session Manager. You can do this from the AWS Console. NOTE: Setting this flag to ``true`` may not be enough by itself. You must also use an AMI that comes with the SSM Agent, or install the SSM Agent yourself. See `Working with SSM Agent <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html>`_ in the SSM Developer Guide. Default: false
        :param termination_policies: A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instances to terminate. The policies are executed in the order that you list them. Default: - ``TerminationPolicy.DEFAULT``
        :param termination_policy_custom_lambda_function_arn: A lambda function Arn that can be used as a custom termination policy to select the instances to terminate. This property must be specified if the TerminationPolicy.CUSTOM_LAMBDA_FUNCTION is used. Default: - No lambda function Arn will be supplied
        :param update_policy: What to do when an AutoScalingGroup's instance configuration is changed. This is applied when any of the settings on the ASG are changed that affect how the instances should be created (VPC, instance type, startup scripts, etc.). It indicates how the existing instances should be replaced with new instances matching the new config. By default, nothing is done and only new instances are launched with the new config. Default: - ``UpdatePolicy.rollingUpdate()`` if using ``init``, ``UpdatePolicy.none()`` otherwise
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place instances within the VPC. Default: - All Private subnets.
        :param vpc: VPC to launch these instances in.
        :param init: Apply the given CloudFormation Init configuration to the instances in the AutoScalingGroup at startup. If you specify ``init``, you must also specify ``signals`` to configure the number of instances to wait for and the timeout for waiting for the init process. Default: - no CloudFormation init
        :param init_options: Use the given options for applying CloudFormation Init. Describes the configsets to use and the timeout to wait Default: - default options
        :param instance_type: Type of instance to launch. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Do not provide any instance type
        :param launch_template: Launch template to use. Launch configuration related settings and MixedInstancesPolicy must not be specified when a launch template is specified. Default: - Do not provide any launch template
        :param machine_image: AMI to launch. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - Do not provide any machine image
        :param max_healthy_percentage: Specifies the upper threshold as a percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. It represents the maximum percentage of the group that can be in service and healthy, or pending, to support your workload when replacing instances. Value range is 0 to 100. After it's set, both ``minHealthyPercentage`` and ``maxHealthyPercentage`` to -1 will clear the previously set value. Both or neither of ``minHealthyPercentage`` and ``maxHealthyPercentage`` must be specified, and the difference between them cannot be greater than 100. A large range increases the number of instances that can be replaced at the same time. Default: - No instance maintenance policy.
        :param min_healthy_percentage: Specifies the lower threshold as a percentage of the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group. It represents the minimum percentage of the group to keep in service, healthy, and ready to use to support your workload when replacing instances. Value range is 0 to 100. After it's set, both ``minHealthyPercentage`` and ``maxHealthyPercentage`` to -1 will clear the previously set value. Both or neither of ``minHealthyPercentage`` and ``maxHealthyPercentage`` must be specified, and the difference between them cannot be greater than 100. A large range increases the number of instances that can be replaced at the same time. Default: - No instance maintenance policy.
        :param mixed_instances_policy: Mixed Instances Policy to use. Launch configuration related settings and Launch Template must not be specified when a MixedInstancesPolicy is specified. Default: - Do not provide any MixedInstancesPolicy
        :param require_imdsv2: Whether IMDSv2 should be required on launched instances. Default: false
        :param role: An IAM role to associate with the instance profile assigned to this Auto Scaling Group. The role must be assumable by the service principal ``ec2.amazonaws.com``: ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: A role will automatically be created, it can be accessed via the ``role`` property
        :param security_group: Security group to launch the instances in. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - A SecurityGroup will be created if none is specified.
        :param user_data: Specific UserData to use. The UserData may still be mutated after creation. ``launchTemplate`` and ``mixedInstancesPolicy`` must not be specified when this property is specified Default: - A UserData object appropriate for the MachineImage's Operating System is created.
