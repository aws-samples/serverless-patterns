# Amazon Cognito Construct Library

[Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) provides
authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. Your users can sign in directly with a
user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, Amazon, Google or Apple.

The two main components of Amazon Cognito are [user
pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) and [identity
pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html). User pools are user directories
that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. Identity pools enable you to grant your users access to
other AWS services. Identity Pool L2 Constructs can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cognito-identitypool-alpha-readme.html).

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project.

## User Pools

User pools allow creating and managing your own directory of users that can sign up and sign in. They enable easy
integration with social identity providers such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft Active Directory, etc. through
SAML.

Using the CDK, a new user pool can be created as part of the stack using the construct's constructor. You may specify
the `userPoolName` to give your own identifier to the user pool. If not, CloudFormation will generate a name.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    user_pool_name="myawesomeapp-userpool",
    sign_in_case_sensitive=False
)
```

By default, usernames and email addresses in user pools are case sensitive, which means `user@example.com` and `User@example.com`
are considered different. In most situations it is preferred to have usernames and email addresses be case insensitive so that
capitalization differences are ignored. As shown above, you can make a user pool case insensitive by setting `signInCaseSensitive`
to `false`. The case sensitivity cannot be changed once a user pool is created.

The default set up for the user pool is configured such that only administrators will be allowed
to create users. Features such as Multi-factor authentication (MFAs) and Lambda Triggers are not
configured by default.

Use the `grant()` method to add an IAM policy statement associated with the user pool to an
IAM principal's policy.

```python
user_pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool")
role = iam.Role(self, "role",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("foo")
)
user_pool.grant(role, "cognito-idp:AdminCreateUser")
```

### Sign Up

Users can either be signed up by the app's administrators or can sign themselves up. Once a user has signed up, their
account needs to be confirmed. Cognito provides several ways to sign users up and confirm their accounts. Learn more
about [user sign up here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/signing-up-users-in-your-app.html).

To verify the email address of a user in your user pool with Amazon Cognito, you can send the user an email message
with a link that they can select, or you can send them a code that they can enter.

#### Code Verification

When a user signs up, email and SMS messages are used to verify their account and contact methods. The following code
snippet configures a user pool with properties relevant to these verification messages -

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    self_sign_up_enabled=True,
    user_verification=cognito.UserVerificationConfig(
        email_subject="Verify your email for our awesome app!",
        email_body="Thanks for signing up to our awesome app! Your verification code is {####}",
        email_style=cognito.VerificationEmailStyle.CODE,
        sms_message="Thanks for signing up to our awesome app! Your verification code is {####}"
    )
)
```

By default, self sign up is disabled. Learn more about [email and SMS verification messages
here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-message-customizations.html).

Besides users signing themselves up, an administrator of any user pool can sign users up. The user then receives an
invitation to join the user pool. The following code snippet configures a user pool with properties relevant to the
invitation messages -

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    user_invitation=cognito.UserInvitationConfig(
        email_subject="Invite to join our awesome app!",
        email_body="Hello {username}, you have been invited to join our awesome app! Your temporary password is {####}",
        sms_message="Hello {username}, your temporary password for our awesome app is {####}"
    )
)
```

#### Link Verification

Alternatively, users can use link as a verification method. The following code snippet configures a user pool with
properties relevant to these verification messages and link verification method.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    user_verification=cognito.UserVerificationConfig(
        email_style=cognito.VerificationEmailStyle.LINK,
        email_subject="Invite to join our awesome app!",
        email_body="You have been invited to join our awesome app! {##Verify Your Email##}"
    )
)
```

All email subjects, bodies and SMS messages for both invitation and verification support Cognito's message templating.
Learn more about [message templates
here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-message-templates.html).

### Sign In

Users registering or signing in into your application can do so with multiple identifiers. There are 4 options
available:

* `username`: Allow signing in using the one time immutable user name that the user chose at the time of sign up.
* `email`: Allow signing in using the email address that is associated with the account.
* `phone`: Allow signing in using the phone number that is associated with the account.
* `preferredUsername`: Allow signing in with an alternate user name that the user can change at any time. However, this
  is not available if the `username` option is not chosen.

The following code sets up a user pool so that the user can sign in with either their username or their email address -

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    # ...
    sign_in_aliases=cognito.SignInAliases(
        username=True,
        email=True
    )
)
```

User pools can either be configured so that user name is primary sign in form, but also allows for the other three to be
used additionally; or it can be configured so that email and/or phone numbers are the only ways a user can register and
sign in. Read more about this
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases-settings).

⚠️ The Cognito service prevents changing the `signInAlias` property for an existing user pool.

To match with 'Option 1' in the above link, with a verified email, `signInAliases` should be set to
`{ username: true, email: true }`. To match with 'Option 2' in the above link with both a verified
email and phone number, this property should be set to `{ email: true, phone: true }`.

Cognito recommends that email and phone number be automatically verified, if they are one of the sign in methods for
the user pool. Read more about that
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases).
The CDK does this by default, when email and/or phone number are specified as part of `signInAliases`. This can be
overridden by specifying the `autoVerify` property.

The following code snippet sets up only email as a sign in alias, but both email and phone number to be auto-verified.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    # ...
    sign_in_aliases=cognito.SignInAliases(username=True, email=True),
    auto_verify=cognito.AutoVerifiedAttrs(email=True, phone=True)
)
```

A user pool can optionally ignore case when evaluating sign-ins. When `signInCaseSensitive` is false, Cognito will not
check the capitalization of the alias when signing in. Default is true.

### Attributes

Attributes represent the various properties of each user that's collected and stored in the user pool. Cognito
provides a set of standard attributes that are available for all user pools. Users are allowed to select any of these
standard attributes to be required. Users will not be able to sign up to the user pool without providing the required
attributes. Besides these, additional attributes can be further defined, and are known as custom attributes.

Learn more on [attributes in Cognito's
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html).

The following code configures a user pool with two standard attributes (name and address) as required and mutable, and adds
four custom attributes.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    standard_attributes=cognito.StandardAttributes(
        fullname=cognito.StandardAttribute(
            required=True,
            mutable=False
        ),
        address=cognito.StandardAttribute(
            required=False,
            mutable=True
        )
    ),
    custom_attributes={
        "myappid": cognito.StringAttribute(min_len=5, max_len=15, mutable=False),
        "callingcode": cognito.NumberAttribute(min=1, max=3, mutable=True),
        "isEmployee": cognito.BooleanAttribute(mutable=True),
        "joinedOn": cognito.DateTimeAttribute()
    }
)
```

As shown in the code snippet, there are data types that are available for custom attributes. The 'String' and 'Number'
data types allow for further constraints on their length and values, respectively.

Custom attributes cannot be marked as required.

All custom attributes share the property `mutable` that specifies whether the value of the attribute can be changed.
The default value is `false`.

User pools come with two 'built-in' attributes - `email_verified` and `phone_number_verified`. These cannot be
configured (required-ness or mutability) as part of user pool creation. However, user pool administrators can modify
them for specific users using the [AdminUpdateUserAttributes API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminUpdateUserAttributes.html).

### Attribute verification

When your user updates an email address or phone number attribute, Amazon Cognito marks it unverified until they verify the new value.
You can’t send messages to an unverified email address or phone number.
Your user can’t sign in with an unverified alias attribute.
You can choose how Amazon Cognito handles an updated email address or phone number after the update and before the verification.

Learn more on [configuring email or phone verification in Cognito's documentation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html?icmpid=docs_cognito_console_help_panel)

The following code configures a user pool that keeps the original value for the two standard attributes (email and phone_number) until the new values are verified.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    sign_in_aliases=cognito.SignInAliases(username=True),
    auto_verify=cognito.AutoVerifiedAttrs(email=True, phone=True),
    keep_original=cognito.KeepOriginalAttrs(
        email=True,
        phone=True
    )
)
```

### Security

Cognito sends various messages to its users via SMS, for different actions, ranging from account verification to
marketing. In order to send SMS messages, Cognito needs an IAM role that it can assume, with permissions that allow it
to send SMS messages.

By default, the CDK looks at all of the specified properties (and their defaults when not explicitly specified) and
automatically creates an SMS role, when needed. For example, if MFA second factor by SMS is enabled, the CDK will
create a new role. The `smsRole` property can be used to specify the user supplied role that should be used instead.
Additionally, the property `enableSmsRole` can be used to override the CDK's default behaviour to either enable or
suppress automatic role creation.

```python
pool_sms_role = iam.Role(self, "userpoolsmsrole",
    assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("foo")
)

cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    sms_role=pool_sms_role,
    sms_role_external_id="c87467be-4f34-11ea-b77f-2e728ce88125"
)
```

When the `smsRole` property is specified, the `smsRoleExternalId` may also be specified. The value of
`smsRoleExternalId` will be used as the `sts:ExternalId` when the Cognito service assumes the role. In turn, the role's
assume role policy should be configured to accept this value as the ExternalId. Learn more about [ExternalId
here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html).

#### Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

User pools can be configured to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). It can either be turned off, set to optional
or made required. Setting MFA to optional means that individual users can choose to enable it.
Additionally, the MFA code can be sent either via SMS text message or via a time-based software token.
See the [documentation on MFA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html) to
learn more.

The following code snippet marks MFA for the user pool as required. This means that all users are required to
configure an MFA token and use it for sign in. It also allows for the users to use both SMS based MFA, as well,
[time-based one time password
(TOTP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa-totp.html).

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    mfa=cognito.Mfa.REQUIRED,
    mfa_second_factor=cognito.MfaSecondFactor(
        sms=True,
        otp=True
    )
)
```

User pools can be configured with policies around a user's password. This includes the password length and the
character sets that they must contain.

Further to this, it can also be configured with the validity of the auto-generated temporary password. A temporary
password is generated by the user pool either when an admin signs up a user or when a password reset is requested.
The validity of this password dictates how long to give the user to use this password before expiring it.

The following code snippet configures these properties -

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    password_policy=cognito.PasswordPolicy(
        min_length=12,
        require_lowercase=True,
        require_uppercase=True,
        require_digits=True,
        require_symbols=True,
        temp_password_validity=Duration.days(3)
    )
)
```

Note that, `tempPasswordValidity` can be specified only in whole days. Specifying fractional days would throw an error.

#### Account Recovery Settings

User pools can be configured on which method a user should use when recovering the password for their account. This
can either be email and/or SMS. Read more at [Recovering User Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-recover-a-user-account.html)

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "UserPool",
    # ...
    account_recovery=cognito.AccountRecovery.EMAIL_ONLY
)
```

The default for account recovery is by phone if available and by email otherwise.
A user will not be allowed to reset their password via phone if they are also using it for MFA.

#### Advanced Security Mode

User pools can be configured to use Advanced security. You can turn the user pool advanced security features on, and customize the actions that are taken in response to different risks. Or you can use audit mode to gather metrics on detected risks without taking action. In audit mode, the advanced security features publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. See the [documentation on Advanced security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html) to learn more.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    advanced_security_mode=cognito.AdvancedSecurityMode.ENFORCED
)
```

### Emails

Cognito sends emails to users in the user pool, when particular actions take place, such as welcome emails, invitation
emails, password resets, etc. The address from which these emails are sent can be configured on the user pool.
Read more at [Email settings for User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-email.html).

By default, user pools are configured to use Cognito's built in email capability, which will send emails
from `no-reply@verificationemail.com`. If you want to use a custom email address you can configure
Cognito to send emails through Amazon SES, which is detailed below.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    email=cognito.UserPoolEmail.with_cognito("support@myawesomeapp.com")
)
```

For typical production environments, the default email limit is below the required delivery volume.
To enable a higher delivery volume, you can configure the UserPool to send emails through Amazon SES. To do
so, follow the steps in the [Cognito Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-email.html#user-pool-email-developer)
to verify an email address, move the account out of the SES sandbox, and grant Cognito email permissions via an
authorization policy.

Once the SES setup is complete, the UserPool can be configured to use the SES email.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    email=cognito.UserPoolEmail.with_sES(
        from_email="noreply@myawesomeapp.com",
        from_name="Awesome App",
        reply_to="support@myawesomeapp.com"
    )
)
```

Sending emails through SES requires that SES be configured (as described above) in a valid SES region.
If the UserPool is being created in a different region, `sesRegion` must be used to specify the correct SES region.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    email=cognito.UserPoolEmail.with_sES(
        ses_region="us-east-1",
        from_email="noreply@myawesomeapp.com",
        from_name="Awesome App",
        reply_to="support@myawesomeapp.com"
    )
)
```

When sending emails from an SES verified domain, `sesVerifiedDomain` can be used to specify the domain.
The email address does not need to be verified when sending emails from a verified domain, because the identity of the email configuration is can be determined from the domain alone.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    email=cognito.UserPoolEmail.with_sES(
        ses_region="us-east-1",
        from_email="noreply@myawesomeapp.com",
        from_name="Awesome App",
        reply_to="support@myawesomeapp.com",
        ses_verified_domain="myawesomeapp.com"
    )
)
```

If `fromName` does not comply RFC 5322 atom or quoted-string, it will be quoted or mime-encoded.

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    email=cognito.UserPoolEmail.with_sES(
        from_email="noreply@myawesomeapp.com",
        from_name="myname@mycompany.com"
    )
)
```

### Device Tracking

User pools can be configured to track devices that users have logged in to.
Read more at [Device Tracking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.html)

```python
cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    device_tracking=cognito.DeviceTracking(
        challenge_required_on_new_device=True,
        device_only_remembered_on_user_prompt=True
    )
)
```

The default is to not track devices.

### Lambda Triggers

User pools can be configured such that AWS Lambda functions can be triggered when certain user operations or actions
occur, such as, sign up, user confirmation, sign in, etc. They can also be used to add custom authentication
challenges, user migrations and custom verification messages. Learn more about triggers at [User Pool Workflows with
Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html).

Lambda triggers can either be specified as part of the `UserPool` initialization, or it can be added later, via methods
on the construct, as so -

```python
auth_challenge_fn = lambda_.Function(self, "authChallengeFn",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "path/to/asset"))
)

userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    # ...
    lambda_triggers=cognito.UserPoolTriggers(
        create_auth_challenge=auth_challenge_fn
    )
)

userpool.add_trigger(cognito.UserPoolOperation.USER_MIGRATION, lambda_.Function(self, "userMigrationFn",
    runtime=lambda_.Runtime.NODEJS_LATEST,
    handler="index.handler",
    code=lambda_.Code.from_asset(path.join(__dirname, "path/to/asset"))
))
```

Additionally, only the pre token generation Lambda trigger supports trigger events with lambda version V2.0:

```python
# userpool: cognito.UserPool
# pre_token_generation_fn: lambda.Function


userpool.add_trigger(cognito.UserPoolOperation.PRE_TOKEN_GENERATION_CONFIG, pre_token_generation_fn, cognito.LambdaVersion.V2_0)
```

The following table lists the set of triggers available, and their corresponding method to add it to the user pool.
For more information on the function of these triggers and how to configure them, read [User Pool Workflows with
Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html).

#### Trigger Permissions

The `function.attachToRolePolicy()` API can be used to add additional IAM permissions to the lambda trigger
as necessary.

⚠️ Using the `attachToRolePolicy` API to provide permissions to your user pool will result in a circular dependency. See [aws/aws-cdk#7016](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/7016).
Error message when running `cdk synth` or `cdk deploy`:

> Circular dependency between resources: [pool056F3F7E, fnPostAuthFnCognitoA630A2B1, ...]

To work around the circular dependency issue, use the `attachInlinePolicy()` API instead, as shown below.

```python
# post_auth_fn: lambda.Function


userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "myuserpool",
    lambda_triggers=cognito.UserPoolTriggers(
        post_authentication=post_auth_fn
    )
)

# provide permissions to describe the user pool scoped to the ARN the user pool
post_auth_fn.role.attach_inline_policy(iam.Policy(self, "userpool-policy",
    statements=[iam.PolicyStatement(
        actions=["cognito-idp:DescribeUserPool"],
        resources=[userpool.user_pool_arn]
    )]
))
```

### Importing User Pools

Any user pool that has been created outside of this stack, can be imported into the CDK app. Importing a user pool
allows for it to be used in other parts of the CDK app that reference an `IUserPool`. However, imported user pools have
limited configurability. As a rule of thumb, none of the properties that are part of the
[`AWS::Cognito::UserPool`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cognito-userpool.html)
CloudFormation resource can be configured.

User pools can be imported either using their id via the `UserPool.fromUserPoolId()`, or by using their ARN, via the
`UserPool.fromUserPoolArn()` API.

```python
awesome_pool = cognito.UserPool.from_user_pool_id(self, "awesome-user-pool", "us-east-1_oiuR12Abd")

other_awesome_pool = cognito.UserPool.from_user_pool_arn(self, "other-awesome-user-pool", "arn:aws:cognito-idp:eu-west-1:123456789012:userpool/us-east-1_mtRyYQ14D")
```

### Identity Providers

Users that are part of a user pool can sign in either directly through a user pool, or federate through a third-party
identity provider. Once configured, the Cognito backend will take care of integrating with the third-party provider.
Read more about [Adding User Pool Sign-in Through a Third
Party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation.html).

The following third-party identity providers are currently supported in the CDK -

* [Login With Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/login-with-amazon)
* [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/)
* [Google Login](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)
* [Sign In With Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/)
* [OpenID Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-oidc-idp.html)
* [SAML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-saml-idp.html)

The following code configures a user pool to federate with the third party provider, 'Login with Amazon'. The identity
provider needs to be configured with a set of credentials that the Cognito backend can use to federate with the
third-party identity provider.

```python
userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")

provider = cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderAmazon(self, "Amazon",
    client_id="amzn-client-id",
    client_secret="amzn-client-secret",
    user_pool=userpool
)
```

Using Google identity provider is possible to use clientSecretValue with SecretValue from secrets manager.

```python
userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
secret = secretsmanager.Secret.from_secret_attributes(self, "CognitoClientSecret",
    secret_complete_arn="arn:aws:secretsmanager:xxx:xxx:secret:xxx-xxx"
).secret_value

provider = cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderGoogle(self, "Google",
    client_id="amzn-client-id",
    client_secret_value=secret,
    user_pool=userpool
)
```

Using SAML identity provider is possible to use SAML metadata file content or SAML metadata file url.

```python
userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")

# specify the metadata as a file content
cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderSaml(self, "userpoolIdpFile",
    user_pool=userpool,
    metadata=cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderSamlMetadata.file("my-file-contents"),
    # Whether to require encrypted SAML assertions from IdP
    encrypted_responses=True,
    # The signing algorithm for the SAML requests
    request_signing_algorithm=cognito.SigningAlgorithm.RSA_SHA256,
    # Enable IdP initiated SAML auth flow
    idp_initiated=True
)

# specify the metadata as a URL
cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderSaml(self, "userpoolidpUrl",
    user_pool=userpool,
    metadata=cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderSamlMetadata.url("https://my-metadata-url.com")
)
```

Attribute mapping allows mapping attributes provided by the third-party identity providers to [standard and custom
attributes](#Attributes) of the user pool. Learn more about [Specifying Identity Provider Attribute Mappings for Your
User Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html).

The following code shows how different attributes provided by 'Login With Amazon' can be mapped to standard and custom
user pool attributes.

```python
userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")

cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderAmazon(self, "Amazon",
    client_id="amzn-client-id",
    client_secret="amzn-client-secret",
    user_pool=userpool,
    attribute_mapping=cognito.AttributeMapping(
        email=cognito.ProviderAttribute.AMAZON_EMAIL,
        website=cognito.ProviderAttribute.other("url"),  # use other() when an attribute is not pre-defined in the CDK
        custom={
            # custom user pool attributes go here
            "unique_id": cognito.ProviderAttribute.AMAZON_USER_ID
        }
    )
)
```

### App Clients

An app is an entity within a user pool that has permission to call unauthenticated APIs (APIs that do not have an
authenticated user), such as APIs to register, sign in, and handle forgotten passwords. To call these APIs, you need an
app client ID and an optional client secret. Read [Configuring a User Pool App
Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html) to learn more.

The following code creates an app client and retrieves the client id -

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "pool")
client = pool.add_client("customer-app-client")
client_id = client.user_pool_client_id
```

Existing app clients can be imported into the CDK app using the `UserPoolClient.fromUserPoolClientId()` API. For new
and imported user pools, clients can also be created via the `UserPoolClient` constructor, as so -

```python
imported_pool = cognito.UserPool.from_user_pool_id(self, "imported-pool", "us-east-1_oiuR12Abd")
cognito.UserPoolClient(self, "customer-app-client",
    user_pool=imported_pool
)
```

Clients can be configured with authentication flows. Authentication flows allow users on a client to be authenticated
with a user pool. Cognito user pools provide several different types of authentication, such as, SRP (Secure
Remote Password) authentication, username-and-password authentication, etc. Learn more about this at [UserPool Authentication
Flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html).

The following code configures a client to use both SRP and username-and-password authentication -

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "pool")
pool.add_client("app-client",
    auth_flows=cognito.AuthFlow(
        user_password=True,
        user_srp=True
    )
)
```

Custom authentication protocols can be configured by setting the `custom` property under `authFlow` and defining lambda
functions for the corresponding user pool [triggers](#lambda-triggers). Learn more at [Custom Authentication
Flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html#amazon-cognito-user-pools-custom-authentication-flow).

In addition to these authentication mechanisms, Cognito user pools also support using OAuth 2.0 framework for
authenticating users. User pool clients can be configured with OAuth 2.0 authorization flows and scopes. Learn more
about the [OAuth 2.0 authorization framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) and [Cognito user pool's
implementation of
OAuth2.0](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/understanding-amazon-cognito-user-pool-oauth-2-0-grants/).

The following code configures an app client with the authorization code grant flow and registers the the app's welcome
page as a callback (or redirect) URL. It also configures the access token scope to 'openid'. All of these concepts can
be found in the [OAuth 2.0 RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749).

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
pool.add_client("app-client",
    o_auth=cognito.OAuthSettings(
        flows=cognito.OAuthFlows(
            authorization_code_grant=True
        ),
        scopes=[cognito.OAuthScope.OPENID],
        callback_urls=["https://my-app-domain.com/welcome"],
        logout_urls=["https://my-app-domain.com/signin"]
    )
)
```

An app client can be configured to prevent user existence errors. This
instructs the Cognito authentication API to return generic authentication
failure responses instead of an UserNotFoundException. By default, the flag
is not set, which means the CloudFormation default (false) will be used. See the
[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-managing-errors.html)
for the full details on the behavior of this flag.

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
pool.add_client("app-client",
    prevent_user_existence_errors=True
)
```

All identity providers created in the CDK app are automatically registered into the corresponding user pool. All app
clients created in the CDK have all of the identity providers enabled by default. The 'Cognito' identity provider,
that allows users to register and sign in directly with the Cognito user pool, is also enabled by default.
Alternatively, the list of supported identity providers for a client can be explicitly specified -

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
pool.add_client("app-client",
    # ...
    supported_identity_providers=[cognito.UserPoolClientIdentityProvider.AMAZON, cognito.UserPoolClientIdentityProvider.COGNITO
    ]
)
```

If the identity provider and the app client are created in the same stack, specify the dependency between both constructs to
make sure that the identity provider already exists when the app client will be created. The app client cannot handle the
dependency to the identity provider automatically because the client does not have access to the provider's construct.

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
provider = cognito.UserPoolIdentityProviderAmazon(self, "Amazon",
    user_pool=pool,
    client_id="amzn-client-id",
    client_secret="amzn-client-secret"
)

client = pool.add_client("app-client",
    # ...
    supported_identity_providers=[cognito.UserPoolClientIdentityProvider.AMAZON
    ]
)

client.node.add_dependency(provider)
```

The property `authSessionValidity` is the session token for each API request in the authentication flow.
Valid duration is from 3 to 15 minutes.

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
pool.add_client("app-client",
    # ...
    auth_session_validity=Duration.minutes(15)
)
```

In accordance with the OIDC open standard, Cognito user pool clients provide access tokens, ID tokens and refresh tokens.
More information is available at [Using Tokens with User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-tokens-with-identity-providers.html).
The expiration time for these tokens can be configured as shown below.

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
pool.add_client("app-client",
    # ...
    access_token_validity=Duration.minutes(60),
    id_token_validity=Duration.minutes(60),
    refresh_token_validity=Duration.days(30)
)
```

Clients can (and should) be allowed to read and write relevant user attributes only. Usually every client can be allowed to
read the `given_name` attribute but not every client should be allowed to set the `email_verified` attribute.
The same criteria applies for both standard and custom attributes, more info is available at
[Attribute Permissions and Scopes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-attribute-permissions-and-scopes).
The default behaviour is to allow read and write permissions on all attributes. The following code shows how this can be
configured for a client.

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")

client_write_attributes = (cognito.ClientAttributes()).with_standard_attributes(fullname=True, email=True).with_custom_attributes("favouritePizza", "favouriteBeverage")

client_read_attributes = client_write_attributes.with_standard_attributes(email_verified=True).with_custom_attributes("pointsEarned")

pool.add_client("app-client",
    # ...
    read_attributes=client_read_attributes,
    write_attributes=client_write_attributes
)
```

[Token revocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/token-revocation.html)
can be configured to be able to revoke refresh tokens in app clients. By default, token revocation is enabled for new user
pools. The property can be used to enable the token revocation in existing app clients or to change the default behavior.

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")
pool.add_client("app-client",
    # ...
    enable_token_revocation=True
)
```

User Pool clients can generate a client ID as well as a client secret, to support more advanced authentication workflows.

To create a client with an autogenerated client secret, pass the `generateSecret: true` prop:

```python
# imported_pool: cognito.UserPool


user_pool_client = cognito.UserPoolClient(self, "UserPoolClient",
    user_pool=imported_pool,
    generate_secret=True
)

# Allows you to pass the generated secret to other pieces of infrastructure
secret = user_pool_client.user_pool_client_secret
```

If you set `enablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData: true`, you can collect and pass
information about your user's session to Amazon Cognito advanced security
when you use the API to sign them up, sign them in, and reset their password.

```python
# imported_pool: cognito.UserPool


user_pool_client = cognito.UserPoolClient(self, "UserPoolClient",
    user_pool=imported_pool,
    generate_secret=True,
    enable_propagate_additional_user_context_data=True
)
```

See [Adding user device and session data to API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication.html#user-pool-settings-adaptive-authentication-device-fingerprint) for more information.

### Resource Servers

A resource server is a server for access-protected resources. It handles authenticated requests from an app that has an
access token. See [Defining Resource
Servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-define-resource-servers.html)
for more information.

An application may choose to model custom permissions via OAuth. Resource Servers provide this capability via custom scopes
that are attached to an app client. The following example sets up a resource server for the 'users' resource for two different
app clients and configures the clients to use these scopes.

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")

read_only_scope = cognito.ResourceServerScope(scope_name="read", scope_description="Read-only access")
full_access_scope = cognito.ResourceServerScope(scope_name="*", scope_description="Full access")

user_server = pool.add_resource_server("ResourceServer",
    identifier="users",
    scopes=[read_only_scope, full_access_scope]
)

read_only_client = pool.add_client("read-only-client",
    # ...
    o_auth=cognito.OAuthSettings(
        # ...
        scopes=[cognito.OAuthScope.resource_server(user_server, read_only_scope)]
    )
)

full_access_client = pool.add_client("full-access-client",
    # ...
    o_auth=cognito.OAuthSettings(
        # ...
        scopes=[cognito.OAuthScope.resource_server(user_server, full_access_scope)]
    )
)
```

### Domains

After setting up an [app client](#app-clients), the address for the user pool's sign-up and sign-in webpages can be
configured using domains. There are two ways to set up a domain - either the Amazon Cognito hosted domain can be chosen
with an available domain prefix, or a custom domain name can be chosen. The custom domain must be one that is already
owned, and whose certificate is registered in AWS Certificate Manager.

The following code sets up a user pool domain in Amazon Cognito hosted domain with the prefix 'my-awesome-app', and
another domain with the custom domain 'user.myapp.com' -

```python
pool = cognito.UserPool(self, "Pool")

pool.add_domain("CognitoDomain",
    cognito_domain=cognito.CognitoDomainOptions(
        domain_prefix="my-awesome-app"
    )
)

certificate_arn = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/11-3336f1-44483d-adc7-9cd375c5169d"

domain_cert = certificatemanager.Certificate.from_certificate_arn(self, "domainCert", certificate_arn)
pool.add_domain("CustomDomain",
    custom_domain=cognito.CustomDomainOptions(
        domain_name="user.myapp.com",
        certificate=domain_cert
    )
)
```

Read more about [Using the Amazon Cognito
Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-assign-domain-prefix.html) and [Using Your Own
Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-add-custom-domain.html).

The `signInUrl()` methods returns the fully qualified URL to the login page for the user pool. This page comes from the
hosted UI configured with Cognito. Learn more at [Hosted UI with the Amazon Cognito
Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-integration.html#cognito-user-pools-create-an-app-integration).

```python
userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "UserPool")
client = userpool.add_client("Client",
    # ...
    o_auth=cognito.OAuthSettings(
        flows=cognito.OAuthFlows(
            implicit_code_grant=True
        ),
        callback_urls=["https://myapp.com/home", "https://myapp.com/users"
        ]
    )
)
domain = userpool.add_domain("Domain")
sign_in_url = domain.sign_in_url(client,
    redirect_uri="https://myapp.com/home"
)
```

Existing domains can be imported into CDK apps using `UserPoolDomain.fromDomainName()` API

```python
my_user_pool_domain = cognito.UserPoolDomain.from_domain_name(self, "my-user-pool-domain", "domain-name")
```

### Deletion protection

Deletion protection can be enabled on a user pool to prevent accidental deletion:

```python
userpool = cognito.UserPool(self, "UserPool",
    # ...
    deletion_protection=True
)
```

By default deletion protection is disabled.

        '''
        :param scope: Scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: Construct identifier for this resource (unique in its scope).
        :param account_recovery_setting: Use this setting to define which verified available method a user can use to recover their password when they call ``ForgotPassword`` . It allows you to define a preferred method when a user has more than one method available. With this setting, SMS does not qualify for a valid password recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS MFA enabled. In the absence of this setting, Cognito uses the legacy behavior to determine the recovery method where SMS is preferred over email.
        :param admin_create_user_config: The configuration for creating a new user profile.
        :param alias_attributes: Attributes supported as an alias for this user pool. Possible values: *phone_number* , *email* , or *preferred_username* . .. epigraph:: This user pool property cannot be updated.
        :param auto_verified_attributes: The attributes to be auto-verified. Possible values: *email* , *phone_number* .
        :param deletion_protection: When active, ``DeletionProtection`` prevents accidental deletion of your user pool. Before you can delete a user pool that you have protected against deletion, you must deactivate this feature. When you try to delete a protected user pool in a ``DeleteUserPool`` API request, Amazon Cognito returns an ``InvalidParameterException`` error. To delete a protected user pool, send a new ``DeleteUserPool`` request after you deactivate deletion protection in an ``UpdateUserPool`` API request.
        :param device_configuration: The device-remembering configuration for a user pool. A null value indicates that you have deactivated device remembering in your user pool. .. epigraph:: When you provide a value for any ``DeviceConfiguration`` field, you activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature.
        :param email_configuration: The email configuration of your user pool. The email configuration type sets your preferred sending method, AWS Region, and sender for messages from your user pool.
        :param email_verification_message: This parameter is no longer used. See `VerificationMessageTemplateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html>`_ .
        :param email_verification_subject: This parameter is no longer used. See `VerificationMessageTemplateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html>`_ .
        :param enabled_mfas: Enables MFA on a specified user pool. To disable all MFAs after it has been enabled, set MfaConfiguration to “OFF” and remove EnabledMfas. MFAs can only be all disabled if MfaConfiguration is OFF. Once SMS_MFA is enabled, SMS_MFA can only be disabled by setting MfaConfiguration to “OFF”. Can be one of the following values: - ``SMS_MFA`` - Enables SMS MFA for the user pool. SMS_MFA can only be enabled if SMS configuration is provided. - ``SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA`` - Enables software token MFA for the user pool. Allowed values: ``SMS_MFA`` | ``SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA``
        :param lambda_config: The Lambda trigger configuration information for the new user pool. .. epigraph:: In a push model, event sources (such as Amazon S3 and custom applications) need permission to invoke a function. So you must make an extra call to add permission for these event sources to invoke your Lambda function. For more information on using the Lambda API to add permission, see `AddPermission <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_AddPermission.html>`_ . For adding permission using the AWS CLI , see `add-permission <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/add-permission.html>`_ .
        :param mfa_configuration: The multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration. Valid values include:. - ``OFF`` MFA won't be used for any users. - ``ON`` MFA is required for all users to sign in. - ``OPTIONAL`` MFA will be required only for individual users who have an MFA factor activated.
        :param policies: The policy associated with a user pool.
        :param schema: The schema attributes for the new user pool. These attributes can be standard or custom attributes. .. epigraph:: During a user pool update, you can add new schema attributes but you cannot modify or delete an existing schema attribute.
        :param sms_authentication_message: A string representing the SMS authentication message.
        :param sms_configuration: The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito user pool must use to send an SMS message from your AWS account through Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the AWS Region that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in your AWS account .
        :param sms_verification_message: This parameter is no longer used. See `VerificationMessageTemplateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html>`_ .
        :param user_attribute_update_settings: The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include the property ``AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate`` , a user-pool setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value of your users' email address and phone number attributes. For more information, see `Verifying updates to email addresses and phone numbers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html#user-pool-settings-verifications-verify-attribute-updates>`_ .
        :param username_attributes: Determines whether email addresses or phone numbers can be specified as user names when a user signs up. Possible values: ``phone_number`` or ``email`` . This user pool property cannot be updated.
        :param username_configuration: You can choose to set case sensitivity on the username input for the selected sign-in option. For example, when this is set to ``False`` , users will be able to sign in using either "username" or "Username". This configuration is immutable once it has been set.
        :param user_pool_add_ons: User pool add-ons. Contains settings for activation of advanced security features. To log user security information but take no action, set to ``AUDIT`` . To configure automatic security responses to risky traffic to your user pool, set to ``ENFORCED`` . For more information, see `Adding advanced security to a user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html>`_ .
        :param user_pool_name: A string used to name the user pool.
        :param user_pool_tags: The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
        :param verification_message_template: The template for the verification message that the user sees when the app requests permission to access the user's information.

            '''The email configuration of your user pool.

            The email configuration type sets your preferred sending method, AWS Region, and sender for messages from your user pool.

            :param configuration_set: The set of configuration rules that can be applied to emails sent using Amazon SES. A configuration set is applied to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. Once applied, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. Configuration sets can be used to apply the following types of rules to emails: - Event publishing – Amazon SES can track the number of send, delivery, open, click, bounce, and complaint events for each email sent. Use event publishing to send information about these events to other AWS services such as SNS and CloudWatch. - IP pool management – When leasing dedicated IP addresses with Amazon SES, you can create groups of IP addresses, called dedicated IP pools. You can then associate the dedicated IP pools with configuration sets.
            :param email_sending_account: Specifies whether Amazon Cognito uses its built-in functionality to send your users email messages, or uses your Amazon Simple Email Service email configuration. Specify one of the following values: - **COGNITO_DEFAULT** - When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses its built-in email functionality. When you use the default option, Amazon Cognito allows only a limited number of emails each day for your user pool. For typical production environments, the default email limit is less than the required delivery volume. To achieve a higher delivery volume, specify DEVELOPER to use your Amazon SES email configuration. To look up the email delivery limit for the default option, see `Limits <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html>`_ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* . The default FROM address is ``no-reply@verificationemail.com`` . To customize the FROM address, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon SES verified email address for the ``SourceArn`` parameter. - **DEVELOPER** - When Amazon Cognito emails your users, it uses your Amazon SES configuration. Amazon Cognito calls Amazon SES on your behalf to send email from your verified email address. When you use this option, the email delivery limits are the same limits that apply to your Amazon SES verified email address in your AWS account . If you use this option, provide the ARN of an Amazon SES verified email address for the ``SourceArn`` parameter. Before Amazon Cognito can email your users, it requires additional permissions to call Amazon SES on your behalf. When you update your user pool with this option, Amazon Cognito creates a *service-linked role* , which is a type of role in your AWS account . This role contains the permissions that allow you to access Amazon SES and send email messages from your email address. For more information about the service-linked role that Amazon Cognito creates, see `Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon Cognito <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html>`_ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* .
            :param from_: Identifies either the sender's email address or the sender's name with their email address. For example, ``testuser@example.com`` or ``Test User <testuser@example.com>`` . This address appears before the body of the email.
            :param reply_to_email_address: The destination to which the receiver of the email should reply.
            :param source_arn: The ARN of a verified email address or an address from a verified domain in Amazon SES. You can set a ``SourceArn`` email from a verified domain only with an API request. You can set a verified email address, but not an address in a verified domain, in the Amazon Cognito console. Amazon Cognito uses the email address that you provide in one of the following ways, depending on the value that you specify for the ``EmailSendingAccount`` parameter: - If you specify ``COGNITO_DEFAULT`` , Amazon Cognito uses this address as the custom FROM address when it emails your users using its built-in email account. - If you specify ``DEVELOPER`` , Amazon Cognito emails your users with this address by calling Amazon SES on your behalf. The Region value of the ``SourceArn`` parameter must indicate a supported AWS Region of your user pool. Typically, the Region in the ``SourceArn`` and the user pool Region are the same. For more information, see `Amazon SES email configuration regions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-email.html#user-pool-email-developer-region-mapping>`_ in the `Amazon Cognito Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html>`_ .

For more information, see `User pool attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html>`_ .

            Developer-only attributes are a legacy feature of user pools, are read-only to all app clients. You can create and update developer-only attributes only with IAM-authenticated API operations. Use app client read/write permissions instead.

            :param attribute_data_type: The data format of the values for your attribute. When you choose an ``AttributeDataType`` , Amazon Cognito validates the input against the data type. A custom attribute value in your user's ID token is always a string, for example ``"custom:isMember" : "true"`` or ``"custom:YearsAsMember" : "12"`` .

Specifies whether the attribute type is developer only. This attribute can only be modified by an administrator. Users will not be able to modify this attribute using their access token.
            :param mutable: Specifies whether the value of the attribute can be changed. Any user pool attribute whose value you map from an IdP attribute must be mutable, with a parameter value of ``true`` . Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If an attribute is immutable, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it attempts to update the attribute. For more information, see `Specifying Identity Provider Attribute Mappings for Your User Pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html>`_ .
            :param name: The name of your user pool attribute. When you create or update a user pool, adding a schema attribute creates a custom or developer-only attribute. When you add an attribute with a ``Name`` value of ``MyAttribute`` , Amazon Cognito creates the custom attribute ``custom:MyAttribute`` . When ``DeveloperOnlyAttribute`` is ``true`` , Amazon Cognito creates your attribute as ``dev:MyAttribute`` . In an operation that describes a user pool, Amazon Cognito returns this value as ``value`` for standard attributes, ``custom:value`` for custom attributes, and ``dev:value`` for developer-only attributes..
            :param number_attribute_constraints: Specifies the constraints for an attribute of the number type.
            :param required: Specifies whether a user pool attribute is required. If the attribute is required and the user doesn't provide a value, registration or sign-in will fail.

        :param scope: Scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: Construct identifier for this resource (unique in its scope).
        :param user_pool_id: The user pool ID for the user pool where you want to create a user pool client.
        :param access_token_validity: The access token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their access token. To specify the time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` as ``seconds`` , ``minutes`` , ``hours`` , or ``days`` , set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request. For example, when you set ``AccessTokenValidity`` to ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` to ``hours`` , your user can authorize access with their access token for 10 hours. The default time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours.
        :param allowed_o_auth_flows: The OAuth grant types that you want your app client to generate. To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add ``client_credentials`` as the only allowed OAuth flow. - **code** - Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint. - **implicit** - Issue the access token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly to your user. - **client_credentials** - Issue the access token from the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint directly to a non-person user using a combination of the client ID and client secret.
        :param allowed_o_auth_flows_user_pool_client: Set to ``true`` to use OAuth 2.0 features in your user pool app client. ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` must be ``true`` before you can configure the following features in your app client. - ``CallBackURLs`` : Callback URLs. - ``LogoutURLs`` : Sign-out redirect URLs. - ``AllowedOAuthScopes`` : OAuth 2.0 scopes. - ``AllowedOAuthFlows`` : Support for authorization code, implicit, and client credentials OAuth 2.0 grants. To use OAuth 2.0 features, configure one of these features in the Amazon Cognito console or set ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` to ``true`` in a ``CreateUserPoolClient`` or ``UpdateUserPoolClient`` API request. If you don't set a value for ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` in a request with the AWS CLI or SDKs, it defaults to ``false`` .
        :param allowed_o_auth_scopes: The allowed OAuth scopes. Possible values provided by OAuth are ``phone`` , ``email`` , ``openid`` , and ``profile`` . Possible values provided by AWS are ``aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`` . Custom scopes created in Resource Servers are also supported.
        :param analytics_configuration: The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign. .. epigraph:: In AWS Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools only support sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects in AWS Region us-east-1. In Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is available, user pools support sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects within that same Region.
        :param auth_session_validity: Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. ``AuthSessionValidity`` is the duration, in minutes, of that session token. Your user pool native user must respond to each authentication challenge before the session expires.
        :param callback_ur_ls: A list of allowed redirect (callback) URLs for the IdPs. A redirect URI must: - Be an absolute URI. - Be registered with the authorization server. - Not include a fragment component. See `OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2>`_ . Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only. App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.
        :param client_name: The client name for the user pool client you would like to create.
        :param default_redirect_uri: The default redirect URI. Must be in the ``CallbackURLs`` list. A redirect URI must: - Be an absolute URI. - Be registered with the authorization server. - Not include a fragment component. See `OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2>`_ . Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only. App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.
        :param enable_propagate_additional_user_context_data: Activates the propagation of additional user context data. For more information about propagation of user context data, see `Adding advanced security to a user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html>`_ . If you don’t include this parameter, you can't send device fingerprint information, including source IP address, to Amazon Cognito advanced security. You can only activate ``EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData`` in an app client that has a client secret.
        :param enable_token_revocation: Activates or deactivates token revocation. For more information about revoking tokens, see `RevokeToken <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeToken.html>`_ . If you don't include this parameter, token revocation is automatically activated for the new user pool client.
        :param explicit_auth_flows: The authentication flows that you want your user pool client to support. For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions. .. epigraph:: If you don't specify a value for ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` , your user client supports ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`` , ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`` , and ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`` . Valid values include: - ``ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` : Enable admin based user password authentication flow ``ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` . This setting replaces the ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password. - ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`` : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication. - ``ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` : Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords. - ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`` : Enable SRP-based authentication. - ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`` : Enable authflow to refresh tokens. In some environments, you will see the values ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` , ``CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY`` , or ``USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` . You can't assign these legacy ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with ``ALLOW_`` , like ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`` .
        :param generate_secret: Boolean to specify whether you want to generate a secret for the user pool client being created.
        :param id_token_validity: The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their ID token. To specify the time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``seconds`` , ``minutes`` , ``hours`` , or ``days`` , set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request. For example, when you set ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``hours`` , your user can authenticate their session with their ID token for 10 hours. The default time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours.
        :param logout_ur_ls: A list of allowed logout URLs for the IdPs.
        :param prevent_user_existence_errors: Use this setting to choose which errors and responses are returned by Cognito APIs during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user does not exist in the user pool. When set to ``ENABLED`` and the user does not exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect, and account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to ``LEGACY`` , those APIs will return a ``UserNotFoundException`` exception if the user does not exist in the user pool.
        :param read_attributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read-only access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. An example of this kind of activity is when your user selects a link to view their profile information. Your app makes a `GetUser <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html>`_ API request to retrieve and display your user's profile data. When you don't specify the ``ReadAttributes`` for your app client, your app can read the values of ``email_verified`` , ``phone_number_verified`` , and the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has read access to these default attributes, ``ReadAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``ReadAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.
        :param refresh_token_validity: The refresh token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their refresh token. To specify the time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``seconds`` , ``minutes`` , ``hours`` , or ``days`` , set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request. For example, when you set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``days`` , your user can refresh their session and retrieve new access and ID tokens for 10 days. The default time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` in an API request is days. You can't set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` to 0. If you do, Amazon Cognito overrides the value with the default value of 30 days.
        :param supported_identity_providers: A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: ``COGNITO`` , ``Facebook`` , ``Google`` , ``SignInWithApple`` , and ``LoginWithAmazon`` . You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example ``MySAMLIdP`` or ``MyOIDCIdP`` .
        :param token_validity_units: The units in which the validity times are represented. The default unit for RefreshToken is days, and default for ID and access tokens are hours.
        :param write_attributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. An example of this kind of activity is when you present your user with a form to update their profile information and they change their last name. Your app then makes an `UpdateUserAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateUserAttributes.html>`_ API request and sets ``family_name`` to the new value. When you don't specify the ``WriteAttributes`` for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, ``WriteAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``WriteAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes. If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute. For more information, see `Specifying IdP Attribute Mappings for Your user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html>`_ .

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnUserPoolClient``.

        :param user_pool_id: The user pool ID for the user pool where you want to create a user pool client.
        :param access_token_validity: The access token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their access token. To specify the time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` as ``seconds`` , ``minutes`` , ``hours`` , or ``days`` , set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request. For example, when you set ``AccessTokenValidity`` to ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` to ``hours`` , your user can authorize access with their access token for 10 hours. The default time unit for ``AccessTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours.
        :param allowed_o_auth_flows: The OAuth grant types that you want your app client to generate. To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add ``client_credentials`` as the only allowed OAuth flow. - **code** - Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint. - **implicit** - Issue the access token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly to your user. - **client_credentials** - Issue the access token from the ``/oauth2/token`` endpoint directly to a non-person user using a combination of the client ID and client secret.
        :param allowed_o_auth_flows_user_pool_client: Set to ``true`` to use OAuth 2.0 features in your user pool app client. ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` must be ``true`` before you can configure the following features in your app client. - ``CallBackURLs`` : Callback URLs. - ``LogoutURLs`` : Sign-out redirect URLs. - ``AllowedOAuthScopes`` : OAuth 2.0 scopes. - ``AllowedOAuthFlows`` : Support for authorization code, implicit, and client credentials OAuth 2.0 grants. To use OAuth 2.0 features, configure one of these features in the Amazon Cognito console or set ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` to ``true`` in a ``CreateUserPoolClient`` or ``UpdateUserPoolClient`` API request. If you don't set a value for ``AllowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient`` in a request with the AWS CLI or SDKs, it defaults to ``false`` .
        :param allowed_o_auth_scopes: The allowed OAuth scopes. Possible values provided by OAuth are ``phone`` , ``email`` , ``openid`` , and ``profile`` . Possible values provided by AWS are ``aws.cognito.signin.user.admin`` . Custom scopes created in Resource Servers are also supported.
        :param analytics_configuration: The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign. .. epigraph:: In AWS Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools only support sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects in AWS Region us-east-1. In Regions where Amazon Pinpoint is available, user pools support sending events to Amazon Pinpoint projects within that same Region.
        :param auth_session_validity: Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. ``AuthSessionValidity`` is the duration, in minutes, of that session token. Your user pool native user must respond to each authentication challenge before the session expires.
        :param callback_ur_ls: A list of allowed redirect (callback) URLs for the IdPs. A redirect URI must: - Be an absolute URI. - Be registered with the authorization server. - Not include a fragment component. See `OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2>`_ . Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only. App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.
        :param client_name: The client name for the user pool client you would like to create.
        :param default_redirect_uri: The default redirect URI. Must be in the ``CallbackURLs`` list. A redirect URI must: - Be an absolute URI. - Be registered with the authorization server. - Not include a fragment component. See `OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2>`_ . Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only. App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.
        :param enable_propagate_additional_user_context_data: Activates the propagation of additional user context data. For more information about propagation of user context data, see `Adding advanced security to a user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html>`_ . If you don’t include this parameter, you can't send device fingerprint information, including source IP address, to Amazon Cognito advanced security. You can only activate ``EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData`` in an app client that has a client secret.
        :param enable_token_revocation: Activates or deactivates token revocation. For more information about revoking tokens, see `RevokeToken <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_RevokeToken.html>`_ . If you don't include this parameter, token revocation is automatically activated for the new user pool client.
        :param explicit_auth_flows: The authentication flows that you want your user pool client to support. For each app client in your user pool, you can sign in your users with any combination of one or more flows, including with a user name and Secure Remote Password (SRP), a user name and password, or a custom authentication process that you define with Lambda functions. .. epigraph:: If you don't specify a value for ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` , your user client supports ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`` , ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`` , and ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`` . Valid values include: - ``ALLOW_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` : Enable admin based user password authentication flow ``ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` . This setting replaces the ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` setting. With this authentication flow, your app passes a user name and password to Amazon Cognito in the request, instead of using the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol to securely transmit the password. - ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_AUTH`` : Enable Lambda trigger based authentication. - ``ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` : Enable user password-based authentication. In this flow, Amazon Cognito receives the password in the request instead of using the SRP protocol to verify passwords. - ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`` : Enable SRP-based authentication. - ``ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH`` : Enable authflow to refresh tokens. In some environments, you will see the values ``ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH`` , ``CUSTOM_AUTH_FLOW_ONLY`` , or ``USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`` . You can't assign these legacy ``ExplicitAuthFlows`` values to user pool clients at the same time as values that begin with ``ALLOW_`` , like ``ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`` .
        :param generate_secret: Boolean to specify whether you want to generate a secret for the user pool client being created.
        :param id_token_validity: The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their ID token. To specify the time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``seconds`` , ``minutes`` , ``hours`` , or ``days`` , set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request. For example, when you set ``IdTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``hours`` , your user can authenticate their session with their ID token for 10 hours. The default time unit for ``IdTokenValidity`` in an API request is hours.
        :param logout_ur_ls: A list of allowed logout URLs for the IdPs.
        :param prevent_user_existence_errors: Use this setting to choose which errors and responses are returned by Cognito APIs during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user does not exist in the user pool. When set to ``ENABLED`` and the user does not exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect, and account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to ``LEGACY`` , those APIs will return a ``UserNotFoundException`` exception if the user does not exist in the user pool.
        :param read_attributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read-only access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. An example of this kind of activity is when your user selects a link to view their profile information. Your app makes a `GetUser <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html>`_ API request to retrieve and display your user's profile data. When you don't specify the ``ReadAttributes`` for your app client, your app can read the values of ``email_verified`` , ``phone_number_verified`` , and the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has read access to these default attributes, ``ReadAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``ReadAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.
        :param refresh_token_validity: The refresh token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use their refresh token. To specify the time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``seconds`` , ``minutes`` , ``hours`` , or ``days`` , set a ``TokenValidityUnits`` value in your API request. For example, when you set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` as ``10`` and ``TokenValidityUnits`` as ``days`` , your user can refresh their session and retrieve new access and ID tokens for 10 days. The default time unit for ``RefreshTokenValidity`` in an API request is days. You can't set ``RefreshTokenValidity`` to 0. If you do, Amazon Cognito overrides the value with the default value of 30 days.
        :param supported_identity_providers: A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: ``COGNITO`` , ``Facebook`` , ``Google`` , ``SignInWithApple`` , and ``LoginWithAmazon`` . You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example ``MySAMLIdP`` or ``MyOIDCIdP`` .
        :param token_validity_units: The units in which the validity times are represented. The default unit for RefreshToken is days, and default for ID and access tokens are hours.
        :param write_attributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. An example of this kind of activity is when you present your user with a form to update their profile information and they change their last name. Your app then makes an `UpdateUserAttributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateUserAttributes.html>`_ API request and sets ``family_name`` to the new value. When you don't specify the ``WriteAttributes`` for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, ``WriteAttributes`` doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ``WriteAttributes`` in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes. If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute. For more information, see `Specifying IdP Attribute Mappings for Your user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-specifying-attribute-mapping.html>`_ .

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnUserPool``.

        :param account_recovery_setting: Use this setting to define which verified available method a user can use to recover their password when they call ``ForgotPassword`` . It allows you to define a preferred method when a user has more than one method available. With this setting, SMS does not qualify for a valid password recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS MFA enabled. In the absence of this setting, Cognito uses the legacy behavior to determine the recovery method where SMS is preferred over email.
        :param admin_create_user_config: The configuration for creating a new user profile.
        :param alias_attributes: Attributes supported as an alias for this user pool. Possible values: *phone_number* , *email* , or *preferred_username* . .. epigraph:: This user pool property cannot be updated.
        :param auto_verified_attributes: The attributes to be auto-verified. Possible values: *email* , *phone_number* .
        :param deletion_protection: When active, ``DeletionProtection`` prevents accidental deletion of your user pool. Before you can delete a user pool that you have protected against deletion, you must deactivate this feature. When you try to delete a protected user pool in a ``DeleteUserPool`` API request, Amazon Cognito returns an ``InvalidParameterException`` error. To delete a protected user pool, send a new ``DeleteUserPool`` request after you deactivate deletion protection in an ``UpdateUserPool`` API request.
        :param device_configuration: The device-remembering configuration for a user pool. A null value indicates that you have deactivated device remembering in your user pool. .. epigraph:: When you provide a value for any ``DeviceConfiguration`` field, you activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature.
        :param email_configuration: The email configuration of your user pool. The email configuration type sets your preferred sending method, AWS Region, and sender for messages from your user pool.
        :param email_verification_message: This parameter is no longer used. See `VerificationMessageTemplateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html>`_ .
        :param email_verification_subject: This parameter is no longer used. See `VerificationMessageTemplateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html>`_ .
        :param enabled_mfas: Enables MFA on a specified user pool. To disable all MFAs after it has been enabled, set MfaConfiguration to “OFF” and remove EnabledMfas. MFAs can only be all disabled if MfaConfiguration is OFF. Once SMS_MFA is enabled, SMS_MFA can only be disabled by setting MfaConfiguration to “OFF”. Can be one of the following values: - ``SMS_MFA`` - Enables SMS MFA for the user pool. SMS_MFA can only be enabled if SMS configuration is provided. - ``SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA`` - Enables software token MFA for the user pool. Allowed values: ``SMS_MFA`` | ``SOFTWARE_TOKEN_MFA``
        :param lambda_config: The Lambda trigger configuration information for the new user pool. .. epigraph:: In a push model, event sources (such as Amazon S3 and custom applications) need permission to invoke a function. So you must make an extra call to add permission for these event sources to invoke your Lambda function. For more information on using the Lambda API to add permission, see `AddPermission <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_AddPermission.html>`_ . For adding permission using the AWS CLI , see `add-permission <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/add-permission.html>`_ .
        :param mfa_configuration: The multi-factor authentication (MFA) configuration. Valid values include:. - ``OFF`` MFA won't be used for any users. - ``ON`` MFA is required for all users to sign in. - ``OPTIONAL`` MFA will be required only for individual users who have an MFA factor activated.
        :param policies: The policy associated with a user pool.
        :param schema: The schema attributes for the new user pool. These attributes can be standard or custom attributes. .. epigraph:: During a user pool update, you can add new schema attributes but you cannot modify or delete an existing schema attribute.
        :param sms_authentication_message: A string representing the SMS authentication message.
        :param sms_configuration: The SMS configuration with the settings that your Amazon Cognito user pool must use to send an SMS message from your AWS account through Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the AWS Region that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in your AWS account .
        :param sms_verification_message: This parameter is no longer used. See `VerificationMessageTemplateType <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_VerificationMessageTemplateType.html>`_ .
        :param user_attribute_update_settings: The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include the property ``AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate`` , a user-pool setting that tells Amazon Cognito how to handle changes to the value of your users' email address and phone number attributes. For more information, see `Verifying updates to email addresses and phone numbers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-email-phone-verification.html#user-pool-settings-verifications-verify-attribute-updates>`_ .
        :param username_attributes: Determines whether email addresses or phone numbers can be specified as user names when a user signs up. Possible values: ``phone_number`` or ``email`` . This user pool property cannot be updated.
        :param username_configuration: You can choose to set case sensitivity on the username input for the selected sign-in option. For example, when this is set to ``False`` , users will be able to sign in using either "username" or "Username". This configuration is immutable once it has been set.
        :param user_pool_add_ons: User pool add-ons. Contains settings for activation of advanced security features. To log user security information but take no action, set to ``AUDIT`` . To configure automatic security responses to risky traffic to your user pool, set to ``ENFORCED`` . For more information, see `Adding advanced security to a user pool <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.html>`_ .
        :param user_pool_name: A string used to name the user pool.
        :param user_pool_tags: The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
        :param verification_message_template: The template for the verification message that the user sees when the app requests permission to access the user's information.

        :param client_metadata: A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers. You create custom workflows by assigning AWS Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminCreateUser API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *pre sign-up* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a ``clientMetadata`` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminCreateUser request. In your function code in AWS Lambda , you can process the ``clientMetadata`` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs. For more information, see `Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html>`_ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* . .. epigraph:: When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito won't do the following: - Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to AWS Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose. - Validate the ClientMetadata value. - Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to provide sensitive information.
        :param desired_delivery_mediums: Specify ``"EMAIL"`` if email will be used to send the welcome message. Specify ``"SMS"`` if the phone number will be used. The default value is ``"SMS"`` . You can specify more than one value.
        :param force_alias_creation: This parameter is used only if the ``phone_number_verified`` or ``email_verified`` attribute is set to ``True`` . Otherwise, it is ignored. If this parameter is set to ``True`` and the phone number or email address specified in the UserAttributes parameter already exists as an alias with a different user, the API call will migrate the alias from the previous user to the newly created user. The previous user will no longer be able to log in using that alias. If this parameter is set to ``False`` , the API throws an ``AliasExistsException`` error if the alias already exists. The default value is ``False`` .
        :param message_action: Set to ``RESEND`` to resend the invitation message to a user that already exists and reset the expiration limit on the user's account. Set to ``SUPPRESS`` to suppress sending the message. You can specify only one value.
        :param user_attributes: An array of name-value pairs that contain user attributes and attribute values.
        :param username: The value that you want to set as the username sign-in attribute. The following conditions apply to the username parameter. - The username can't be a duplicate of another username in the same user pool. - You can't change the value of a username after you create it. - You can only provide a value if usernames are a valid sign-in attribute for your user pool. If your user pool only supports phone numbers or email addresses as sign-in attributes, Amazon Cognito automatically generates a username value. For more information, see `Customizing sign-in attributes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html#user-pool-settings-aliases>`_ .
        :param validation_data: Temporary user attributes that contribute to the outcomes of your pre sign-up Lambda trigger. This set of key-value pairs are for custom validation of information that you collect from your users but don't need to retain. Your Lambda function can analyze this additional data and act on it. Your function might perform external API operations like logging user attributes and validation data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Validation data might also affect the response that your function returns to Amazon Cognito, like automatically confirming the user if they sign up from within your network. For more information about the pre sign-up Lambda trigger, see `Pre sign-up Lambda trigger <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-sign-up.html>`_ .

        :param client_metadata: A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers. You create custom workflows by assigning AWS Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminCreateUser API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *pre sign-up* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a ``clientMetadata`` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminCreateUser request. In your function code in AWS Lambda , you can process the ``clientMetadata`` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs. For more information, see `Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html>`_ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* . .. epigraph:: When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito won't do the following: - Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to AWS Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose. - Validate the ClientMetadata value. - Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to provide sensitive information.
        :param desired_delivery_mediums: Specify ``"EMAIL"`` if email will be used to send the welcome message. Specify ``"SMS"`` if the phone number will be used. The default value is ``"SMS"`` . You can specify more than one value.
        :param force_alias_creation: This parameter is used only if the ``phone_number_verified`` or ``email_verified`` attribute is set to ``True`` . Otherwise, it is ignored. If this parameter is set to ``True`` and the phone number or email address specified in the UserAttributes parameter already exists as an alias with a different user, the API call will migrate the alias from the previous user to the newly created user. The previous user will no longer be able to log in using that alias. If this parameter is set to ``False`` , the API throws an ``AliasExistsException`` error if the alias already exists. The default value is ``False`` .

        :param user_attributes: An array of name-value pairs that contain user attributes and attribute values.

The following conditions apply to the username parameter. - The username can't be a duplicate of another username in the same user pool. - You can't change the value of a username after you create it. - You can only provide a value if usernames are a valid sign-in attribute for your user pool. If your user pool only supports phone numbers or email addresses as sign-in attributes, Amazon Cognito automatically generates a username value.

        :param validation_data: Temporary user attributes that contribute to the outcomes of your pre sign-up Lambda trigger. This set of key-value pairs are for custom validation of information that you collect from your users but don't need to retain. Your Lambda function can analyze this additional data and act on it. Your function might perform external API operations like logging user attributes and validation data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Validation data might also affect the response that your function returns to Amazon Cognito, like automatically confirming the user if they sign up from within your network.

        You create custom workflows by assigning AWS Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminCreateUser API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the *pre sign-up* trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a ``clientMetadata`` attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminCreateUser request. In your function code in AWS Lambda , you can process the ``clientMetadata`` value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs.

        For more information, see `Customizing user pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html>`_ in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide* .
        .. epigraph::

           When you use the ClientMetadata parameter, remember that Amazon Cognito won't do the following:

           - Store the ClientMetadata value. This data is available only to AWS Lambda triggers that are assigned to a user pool to support custom workflows. If your user pool configuration doesn't include triggers, the ClientMetadata parameter serves no purpose.
           - Validate the ClientMetadata value.
           - Encrypt the ClientMetadata value. Don't use Amazon Cognito to provide sensitive information.

        :param auto_verify: Attributes which Cognito will look to verify automatically upon user sign up. EMAIL and PHONE are the only available options. Default: - If ``signInAlias`` includes email and/or phone, they will be included in ``autoVerifiedAttributes`` by default. If absent, no attributes will be auto-verified.
        :param custom_attributes: Define a set of custom attributes that can be configured for each user in the user pool. Default: - No custom attributes.
        :param custom_sender_kms_key: This key will be used to encrypt temporary passwords and authorization codes that Amazon Cognito generates. Default: - no key ID configured
        :param deletion_protection: Indicates whether the user pool should have deletion protection enabled. Default: false
        :param device_tracking: Device tracking settings. Default: - see defaults on each property of DeviceTracking.
        :param email: Email settings for a user pool. Default: - cognito will use the default email configuration
        :param enable_sms_role: Setting this would explicitly enable or disable SMS role creation. When left unspecified, CDK will determine based on other properties if a role is needed or not. Default: - CDK will determine based on other properties of the user pool if an SMS role should be created or not.
        :param keep_original: Attributes which Cognito will look to handle changes to the value of your users' email address and phone number attributes. EMAIL and PHONE are the only available options. Default: - Nothing is kept.
        :param lambda_triggers: Lambda functions to use for supported Cognito triggers. Default: - No Lambda triggers.
        :param mfa: Configure whether users of this user pool can or are required use MFA to sign in. Default: Mfa.OFF
        :param mfa_message: The SMS message template sent during MFA verification. Use '{####}' in the template where Cognito should insert the verification code. Default: 'Your authentication code is {####}.'
        :param mfa_second_factor: Configure the MFA types that users can use in this user pool. Ignored if ``mfa`` is set to ``OFF``. Default: - { sms: true, otp: false }, if ``mfa`` is set to ``OPTIONAL`` or ``REQUIRED``. { sms: false, otp: false }, otherwise
        :param password_policy: Password policy for this user pool. Default: - see defaults on each property of PasswordPolicy.
        :param removal_policy: Policy to apply when the user pool is removed from the stack. Default: RemovalPolicy.RETAIN
        :param self_sign_up_enabled: Whether self sign-up should be enabled. To configure self sign-up configuration use the ``userVerification`` property. Default: - false
        :param sign_in_aliases: Methods in which a user registers or signs in to a user pool. Allows either username with aliases OR sign in with email, phone, or both. Read the sections on usernames and aliases to learn more - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html To match with 'Option 1' in the above link, with a verified email, this property should be set to ``{ username: true, email: true }``. To match with 'Option 2' in the above link with both a verified email and phone number, this property should be set to ``{ email: true, phone: true }``. Default: { username: true }
        :param sign_in_case_sensitive: Whether sign-in aliases should be evaluated with case sensitivity. For example, when this option is set to false, users will be able to sign in using either ``MyUsername`` or ``myusername``. Default: true
        :param sms_role: The IAM role that Cognito will assume while sending SMS messages. Default: - a new IAM role is created.
        :param sms_role_external_id: The 'ExternalId' that Cognito service must be using when assuming the ``smsRole``, if the role is restricted with an 'sts:ExternalId' conditional. Learn more about ExternalId here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html This property will be ignored if ``smsRole`` is not specified. Default: - No external id will be configured.
        :param sns_region: The region to integrate with SNS to send SMS messages. This property will do nothing if SMS configuration is not configured. Default: - The same region as the user pool, with a few exceptions - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-sms-settings.html#user-pool-sms-settings-first-time
        :param standard_attributes: The set of attributes that are required for every user in the user pool. Read more on attributes here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html Default: - All standard attributes are optional and mutable.
        :param user_invitation: Configuration around admins signing up users into a user pool. Default: - see defaults in UserInvitationConfig.
        :param user_pool_name: Name of the user pool. Default: - automatically generated name by CloudFormation at deploy time.
