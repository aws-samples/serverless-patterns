# Amazon Relational Database Service Construct Library

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_rds as rds
```

## Starting a clustered database

To set up a clustered database (like Aurora), define a `DatabaseCluster`. You must
always launch a database in a VPC. Use the `vpcSubnets` attribute to control whether
your instances will be launched privately or publicly:

You must specify the instance to use as the writer, along with an optional list
of readers (up to 15).

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    credentials=rds.Credentials.from_generated_secret("clusteradmin"),  # Optional - will default to 'admin' username and generated password
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer",
        publicly_accessible=False
    ),
    readers=[
        rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("reader1", promotion_tier=1),
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader2")
    ],
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
    ),
    vpc=vpc
)
```

To adopt Aurora I/O-Optimized, specify `DBClusterStorageType.AURORA_IOPT1` on the `storageType` property.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_postgres(version=rds.AuroraPostgresEngineVersion.VER_15_2),
    credentials=rds.Credentials.from_username("adminuser", password=SecretValue.unsafe_plain_text("7959866cacc02c2d243ecfe177464fe6")),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer",
        publicly_accessible=False
    ),
    readers=[
        rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("reader")
    ],
    storage_type=rds.DBClusterStorageType.AURORA_IOPT1,
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
    ),
    vpc=vpc
)
```

If there isn't a constant for the exact version you want to use,
all of the `Version` classes have a static `of` method that can be used to create an arbitrary version.

```python
custom_engine_version = rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.of("5.7.mysql_aurora.2.08.1")
```

By default, the master password will be generated and stored in AWS Secrets Manager with auto-generated description.

Your cluster will be empty by default. To add a default database upon construction, specify the
`defaultDatabaseName` attribute.

To use dual-stack mode, specify `NetworkType.DUAL` on the `networkType` property:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# VPC and subnets must have IPv6 CIDR blocks
cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_02_1),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer",
        publicly_accessible=False
    ),
    vpc=vpc,
    network_type=rds.NetworkType.DUAL
)
```

For more information about dual-stack mode, see [Working with a DB cluster in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html).

Use `DatabaseClusterFromSnapshot` to create a cluster from a snapshot:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

rds.DatabaseClusterFromSnapshot(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora(version=rds.AuroraEngineVersion.VER_1_22_2),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    vpc=vpc,
    snapshot_identifier="mySnapshot"
)
```

### Updating the database instances in a cluster

Database cluster instances may be updated in bulk or on a rolling basis.

An update to all instances in a cluster may cause significant downtime. To reduce the downtime, set the
`instanceUpdateBehavior` property in `DatabaseClusterBaseProps` to `InstanceUpdateBehavior.ROLLING`.
This adds a dependency between each instance so the update is performed on only one instance at a time.

Use `InstanceUpdateBehavior.BULK` to update all instances at once.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("Instance",
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE3, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL)
    ),
    readers=[rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("reader")],
    instance_update_behaviour=rds.InstanceUpdateBehaviour.ROLLING,  # Optional - defaults to rds.InstanceUpdateBehaviour.BULK
    vpc=vpc
)
```

### Serverless V2 instances in a Cluster

It is possible to create an RDS cluster with *both* serverlessV2 and provisioned
instances. For example, this will create a cluster with a provisioned writer and
a serverless v2 reader.

> *Note* Before getting starting with this type of cluster it is
> highly recommended that you read through the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.setting-capacity.html)
> which goes into much more detail on the things you need to take into
> consideration.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    readers=[
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader")
    ],
    vpc=vpc
)
```

### Monitoring

There are some CloudWatch metrics that are [important for Aurora Serverless
v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.setting-capacity.html#aurora-serverless-v2.viewing.monitoring).

* `ServerlessDatabaseCapacity`: An instance-level metric that can also be
  evaluated at the cluster level. At the cluster-level it represents the average
  capacity of all the instances in the cluster.
* `ACUUtilization`: Value of the `ServerlessDatabaseCapacity`/ max ACU of the
  cluster.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    readers=[
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader")
    ],
    vpc=vpc
)

cluster.metric_serverless_database_capacity(
    period=Duration.minutes(10)
).create_alarm(self, "capacity",
    threshold=1.5,
    evaluation_periods=3
)
cluster.metric_aCUUtilization(
    period=Duration.minutes(10)
).create_alarm(self, "alarm",
    evaluation_periods=3,
    threshold=90
)
```

#### Capacity & Scaling

There are some things to take into consideration with Aurora Serverless v2.

To create a cluster that can support serverless v2 instances you configure a
minimum and maximum capacity range on the cluster. This is an example showing
the default values:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("writer"),
    serverless_v2_min_capacity=0.5,
    serverless_v2_max_capacity=2,
    vpc=vpc
)
```

The capacity is defined as a number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs). You can
specify in half-step increments (40, 40.5, 41, etc). Each serverless instance in
the cluster inherits the capacity that is defined on the cluster. It is not
possible to configure separate capacity at the instance level.

The maximum capacity is mainly used for budget control since it allows you to
set a cap on how high your instance can scale.

The minimum capacity is a little more involved. This controls a couple different
things.

* The scale-up rate is proportional to the current capacity (larger instances
  scale up faster)

  * Adjust the minimum capacity to obtain a suitable scaling rate
* Network throughput is proportional to capacity

> *Info* More complete details can be found [in the docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.setting-capacity.html#aurora-serverless-v2-examples-setting-capacity-range-for-cluster)

Another way that you control the capacity/scaling of your serverless v2 reader
instances is based on the [promotion tier](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/additional-failover-control-for-amazon-aurora/)
which can be between 0-15. Any serverless v2 instance in the 0-1 tiers will scale alongside the
writer even if the current read load does not require the capacity. This is
because instances in the 0-1 tier are first priority for failover and Aurora
wants to ensure that in the event of a failover the reader that gets promoted is
scaled to handle the write load.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("writer"),
    readers=[
        # will be put in promotion tier 1 and will scale with the writer
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader1", scale_with_writer=True),
        # will be put in promotion tier 2 and will not scale with the writer
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader2")
    ],
    vpc=vpc
)
```

* When the writer scales up, any readers in tier 0-1 will scale up to match
* Scaling for tier 2-15 is independent of what is happening on the writer
* Readers in tier 2-15 scale up based on read load against the individual reader

When configuring your cluster it is important to take this into consideration
and ensure that in the event of a failover there is an instance that is scaled
up to take over.

### Mixing Serverless v2 and Provisioned instances

You are able to create a cluster that has both provisioned and serverless
instances. [This blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/evaluate-amazon-aurora-serverless-v2-for-your-provisioned-aurora-clusters/)
has an excellent guide on choosing between serverless and provisioned instances
based on use case.

There are a couple of high level differences:

* Engine Version (serverless only supports MySQL 8+ & PostgreSQL 13+)
* Memory up to 256GB can be supported by serverless

#### Provisioned writer

With a provisioned writer and serverless v2 readers, some of the serverless
readers will need to be configured to scale with the writer so they can act as
failover targets. You will need to determine the correct capacity based on the
provisioned instance type and it's utilization.

As an example, if the CPU utilization for a db.r6g.4xlarge (128 GB) instance
stays at 10% most times, then the minimum ACUs may be set at 6.5 ACUs
(10% of 128 GB) and maximum may be set at 64 ACUs (64x2GB=128GB). Keep in mind
that the speed at which the serverless instance can scale up is determined by
the minimum capacity so if your cluster has spiky workloads you may need to set
a higher minimum capacity.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer",
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.R6G, ec2.InstanceSize.XLARGE4)
    ),
    serverless_v2_min_capacity=6.5,
    serverless_v2_max_capacity=64,
    readers=[
        # will be put in promotion tier 1 and will scale with the writer
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader1", scale_with_writer=True),
        # will be put in promotion tier 2 and will not scale with the writer
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader2")
    ],
    vpc=vpc
)
```

In the above example `reader1` will scale with the writer based on the writer's
utilization. So if the writer were to go to `50%` utilization then `reader1`
would scale up to use `32` ACUs. If the read load stayed consistent then
`reader2` may remain at `6.5` since it is not configured to scale with the
writer.

If one of your Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances consistently reaches the
limit of its maximum capacity, Aurora indicates this condition by setting the
DB instance to a status of `incompatible-parameters`. While the DB instance has
the incompatible-parameters status, some operations are blocked. For example,
you can't upgrade the engine version.

#### CA certificate

Use the `caCertificate` property to specify the [CA certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html)
to use for a cluster instances:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_01_0),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer",
        ca_certificate=rds.CaCertificate.RDS_CA_RSA2048_G1
    ),
    readers=[
        rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("reader",
            ca_certificate=rds.CaCertificate.of("custom-ca")
        )
    ],
    vpc=vpc
)
```

### Migrating from instanceProps

Creating instances in a `DatabaseCluster` using `instanceProps` & `instances` is
deprecated. To migrate to the new properties you can provide the
`isFromLegacyInstanceProps` property.

For example, in order to migrate from this deprecated config:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(
        version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_03_0
    ),
    instances=2,
    instance_props=rds.InstanceProps(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE3, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
        vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC),
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
```

You would need to migrate to this. The old method of providing `instanceProps`
and `instances` will create the number of `instances` that you provide. The
first instance will be the writer and the rest will be the readers. It's
important that the `id` that you provide is `Instance{NUMBER}`. The writer
should always be `Instance1` and the readers will increment from there.

Make sure to run a `cdk diff` before deploying to make sure that all changes are
expected. **Always test the migration in a non-production environment first.**

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
instance_props = {
    "instance_type": ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE3, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
    "is_from_legacy_instance_props": True
}
cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(
        version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_03_0
    ),
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC),
    vpc=vpc,
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("Instance1",
        instance_type=instance_props.instance_type,
        is_from_legacy_instance_props=instance_props.is_from_legacy_instance_props
    ),
    readers=[
        rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("Instance2",
            instance_type=instance_props.instance_type,
            is_from_legacy_instance_props=instance_props.is_from_legacy_instance_props
        )
    ]
)
```

## Starting an instance database

To set up an instance database, define a `DatabaseInstance`. You must
always launch a database in a VPC. Use the `vpcSubnets` attribute to control whether
your instances will be launched privately or publicly:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.oracle_se2(version=rds.OracleEngineVersion.VER_19_0_0_0_2020_04_R1),
    # optional, defaults to m5.large
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE3, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
    credentials=rds.Credentials.from_generated_secret("syscdk"),  # Optional - will default to 'admin' username and generated password
    vpc=vpc,
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
    )
)
```

If there isn't a constant for the exact engine version you want to use,
all of the `Version` classes have a static `of` method that can be used to create an arbitrary version.

```python
custom_engine_version = rds.OracleEngineVersion.of("19.0.0.0.ru-2020-04.rur-2020-04.r1", "19")
```

By default, the master password will be generated and stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

To use the storage auto scaling option of RDS you can specify the maximum allocated storage.
This is the upper limit to which RDS can automatically scale the storage. More info can be found
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling)
Example for max storage configuration:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres(version=rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_3),
    # optional, defaults to m5.large
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
    vpc=vpc,
    max_allocated_storage=200
)
```

To use dual-stack mode, specify `NetworkType.DUAL` on the `networkType` property:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# VPC and subnets must have IPv6 CIDR blocks
instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres(version=rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_3),
    vpc=vpc,
    network_type=rds.NetworkType.DUAL,
    publicly_accessible=False
)
```

For more information about dual-stack mode, see [Working with a DB instance in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html).

Use `DatabaseInstanceFromSnapshot` and `DatabaseInstanceReadReplica` to create an instance from snapshot or
a source database respectively:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

# source_instance: rds.DatabaseInstance

rds.DatabaseInstanceFromSnapshot(self, "Instance",
    snapshot_identifier="my-snapshot",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres(version=rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_3),
    # optional, defaults to m5.large
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    vpc=vpc
)
rds.DatabaseInstanceReadReplica(self, "ReadReplica",
    source_database_instance=source_instance,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    vpc=vpc
)
```

Automatic backups of read replica instances are only supported for MySQL and MariaDB. By default,
automatic backups are disabled for read replicas and can only be enabled (using `backupRetention`)
if also enabled on the source instance.

Creating a "production" Oracle database instance with option and parameter groups:

```python
# Set open cursors with parameter group
parameter_group = rds.ParameterGroup(self, "ParameterGroup",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.oracle_se2(version=rds.OracleEngineVersion.VER_19_0_0_0_2020_04_R1),
    parameters={
        "open_cursors": "2500"
    }
)

option_group = rds.OptionGroup(self, "OptionGroup",

        vpc=vpc
    )
    ]
)

availability_rule.add_event_pattern(
    detail={

```

Use the `storageType` property to specify the [type of storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Storage.html)
to use for the instance:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


iops_instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "IopsInstance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_30),
    vpc=vpc,
    storage_type=rds.StorageType.IO1,
    iops=5000
)

gp3_instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Gp3Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_30),
    vpc=vpc,
    allocated_storage=500,
    storage_type=rds.StorageType.GP3,
    storage_throughput=500
)
```

Use the `allocatedStorage` property to specify the amount of storage (in gigabytes) that is initially allocated for the instance
to use for the instance:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

# Setting allocatedStorage for DatabaseInstance replica
# Note: If allocatedStorage isn't set here, the replica instance will inherit the allocatedStorage of the source instance
# source_instance: rds.DatabaseInstance


# Setting allocatedStorage for DatabaseInstance
iops_instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "IopsInstance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_30),
    vpc=vpc,
    storage_type=rds.StorageType.IO1,
    iops=5000,
    allocated_storage=500
)
rds.DatabaseInstanceReadReplica(self, "ReadReplica",
    source_database_instance=source_instance,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE2, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    vpc=vpc,
    allocated_storage=500
)
```

Use the `caCertificate` property to specify the [CA certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html)
to use for the instance:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_30),
    vpc=vpc,
    ca_certificate=rds.CaCertificate.RDS_CA_RSA2048_G1
)
```

You can specify a custom CA certificate with:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_30),
    vpc=vpc,
    ca_certificate=rds.CaCertificate.of("future-rds-ca")
)
```

## Setting Public Accessibility

You can set public accessibility for the `DatabaseInstance` or the `ClusterInstance` using the `publiclyAccessible` property.
If you specify `true`, it creates an instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address.
If you specify `false`, it creates an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

The default value will be `true` if `vpcSubnets` is `subnetType: SubnetType.PUBLIC`, `false` otherwise. In the case of a
cluster, the default value will be determined on the vpc placement of the `DatabaseCluster` otherwise it will be determined
based on the vpc placement of standalone `DatabaseInstance`.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

# Setting public accessibility for DB instance
rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(
        version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_19
    ),
    vpc=vpc,
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
    ),
    publicly_accessible=True
)

# Setting public accessibility for DB cluster instance
rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "DatabaseCluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(
        version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_03_0
    ),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.serverless_v2("Writer",
        publicly_accessible=True
    ),
    vpc=vpc,
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(
        subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS
    )
)
```

## Instance events

To define Amazon CloudWatch event rules for database instances, use the `onEvent`
method:

```python
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance
# fn: lambda.Function

rule = instance.on_event("InstanceEvent", target=targets.LambdaFunction(fn))
```

## Login credentials

By default, database instances and clusters (with the exception of `DatabaseInstanceFromSnapshot` and `ServerlessClusterFromSnapshot`) will have `admin` user with an auto-generated password.
An alternative username (and password) may be specified for the admin user instead of the default.

The following examples use a `DatabaseInstance`, but the same usage is applicable to `DatabaseCluster`.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

engine = rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres(version=rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_3)
rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "InstanceWithUsername",
    engine=engine,
    vpc=vpc,
    credentials=rds.Credentials.from_generated_secret("postgres")
)

rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "InstanceWithUsernameAndPassword",
    engine=engine,
    vpc=vpc,
    credentials=rds.Credentials.from_password("postgres", SecretValue.ssm_secure("/dbPassword", "1"))
)

my_secret = secretsmanager.Secret.from_secret_name(self, "DBSecret", "myDBLoginInfo")
rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "InstanceWithSecretLogin",
    engine=engine,
    vpc=vpc,
    credentials=rds.Credentials.from_secret(my_secret)
)
```

Secrets generated by `fromGeneratedSecret()` can be customized:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

engine = rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres(version=rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_3)
my_key = kms.Key(self, "MyKey")

rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "InstanceWithCustomizedSecret",
    engine=engine,
    vpc=vpc,
    credentials=rds.Credentials.from_generated_secret("postgres",
        secret_name="my-cool-name",
        encryption_key=my_key,
        exclude_characters="!&*^#@()",
        replica_regions=[secretsmanager.ReplicaRegion(region="eu-west-1"), secretsmanager.ReplicaRegion(region="eu-west-2")]
    )
)
```

### Snapshot credentials

As noted above, Databases created with `DatabaseInstanceFromSnapshot` or `ServerlessClusterFromSnapshot` will not create user and auto-generated password by default because it's not possible to change the master username for a snapshot. Instead, they will use the existing username and password from the snapshot. You can still generate a new password - to generate a secret similarly to the other constructs, pass in credentials with `fromGeneratedSecret()` or `fromGeneratedPassword()`.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

engine = rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres(version=rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_3)
my_key = kms.Key(self, "MyKey")

rds.DatabaseInstanceFromSnapshot(self, "InstanceFromSnapshotWithCustomizedSecret",
    engine=engine,
    vpc=vpc,
    snapshot_identifier="mySnapshot",
    credentials=rds.SnapshotCredentials.from_generated_secret("username",
        encryption_key=my_key,
        exclude_characters="!&*^#@()",
        replica_regions=[secretsmanager.ReplicaRegion(region="eu-west-1"), secretsmanager.ReplicaRegion(region="eu-west-2")]
    )
)
```

## Connecting

To control who can access the cluster or instance, use the `.connections` attribute. RDS databases have
a default port, so you don't need to specify the port:

```python
# cluster: rds.DatabaseCluster

cluster.connections.allow_from_any_ipv4(ec2.Port.all_traffic(), "Open to the world")
```

The endpoints to access your database cluster will be available as the `.clusterEndpoint` and `.readerEndpoint`
attributes:

```python
# cluster: rds.DatabaseCluster

write_address = cluster.cluster_endpoint.socket_address
```

For an instance database:

```python
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance

address = instance.instance_endpoint.socket_address
```

## Rotating credentials

When the master password is generated and stored in AWS Secrets Manager, it can be rotated automatically:

```python
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance
# my_security_group: ec2.SecurityGroup


instance.add_rotation_single_user(
    automatically_after=Duration.days(7),  # defaults to 30 days
    exclude_characters="!@#$%^&*",  # defaults to the set " %+~`#/// here*()|[]{}:;<>?!'/@\"\\"
    security_group=my_security_group
)
```

```python
cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(stack, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA,
    instance_props=cdk.aws_rds.InstanceProps(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE3, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
        vpc=vpc
    )
)

cluster.add_rotation_single_user()

cluster_with_custom_rotation_options = rds.DatabaseCluster(stack, "CustomRotationOptions",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA,
    instance_props=cdk.aws_rds.InstanceProps(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE3, ec2.InstanceSize.SMALL),
        vpc=vpc
    )
)
cluster_with_custom_rotation_options.add_rotation_single_user(
    automatically_after=cdk.Duration.days(7),
    exclude_characters="!@#$%^&*",
    security_group=security_group,
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS),
    endpoint=endpoint
)
```

The multi user rotation scheme is also available:

```python
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance
# my_imported_secret: rds.DatabaseSecret

instance.add_rotation_multi_user("MyUser",
    secret=my_imported_secret
)
```

It's also possible to create user credentials together with the instance/cluster and add rotation:

```python
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance

my_user_secret = rds.DatabaseSecret(self, "MyUserSecret",
    username="myuser",
    secret_name="my-user-secret",  # optional, defaults to a CloudFormation-generated name
    dbname="mydb",  # optional, defaults to the main database of the RDS cluster this secret gets attached to
    master_secret=instance.secret,
    exclude_characters="{}[]()'\"/\\"
)
my_user_secret_attached = my_user_secret.attach(instance) # Adds DB connections information in the secret

instance.add_rotation_multi_user("MyUser",  # Add rotation using the multi user scheme
    secret=my_user_secret_attached)
```

**Note**: This user must be created manually in the database using the master credentials.
The rotation will start as soon as this user exists.

Access to the Secrets Manager API is required for the secret rotation. This can be achieved either with
internet connectivity (through NAT) or with a VPC interface endpoint. By default, the rotation Lambda function
is deployed in the same subnets as the instance/cluster. If access to the Secrets Manager API is not possible from
those subnets or using the default API endpoint, use the `vpcSubnets` and/or `endpoint` options:

```python
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance
# my_endpoint: ec2.InterfaceVpcEndpoint


instance.add_rotation_single_user(
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS),  # Place rotation Lambda in private subnets
    endpoint=my_endpoint
)
```

See also [aws-cdk-lib/aws-secretsmanager](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/main/packages/aws-cdk-lib/aws-secretsmanager/README.md) for credentials rotation of existing clusters/instances.

By default, any stack updates will cause AWS Secrets Manager to rotate a secret immediately. To prevent this behavior and wait until the next scheduled rotation window specified via the `automaticallyAfter` property, set the `rotateImmediatelyOnUpdate` property to false:

```python
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance
# my_security_group: ec2.SecurityGroup


instance.add_rotation_single_user(
    automatically_after=Duration.days(7),  # defaults to 30 days
    exclude_characters="!@#$%^&*",  # defaults to the set " %+~`#/// here*()|[]{}:;<>?!'/@\"\\"
    security_group=my_security_group,  # defaults to an auto-created security group
    rotate_immediately_on_update=False
)
```

## IAM Authentication

You can also authenticate to a database instance using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication;
See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html) for more information
and a list of supported versions and limitations.

The following example shows enabling IAM authentication for a database instance and granting connection access to an IAM role.

### Instance

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_19),
    vpc=vpc,
    iam_authentication=True
)
role = iam.Role(self, "DBRole", assumed_by=iam.AccountPrincipal(self.account))
instance.grant_connect(role)
```

### Proxy

The following example shows granting connection access for RDS Proxy to an IAM role.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(
        version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_03_0
    ),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    vpc=vpc
)

proxy = rds.DatabaseProxy(self, "Proxy",
    proxy_target=rds.ProxyTarget.from_cluster(cluster),
    secrets=[cluster.secret],
    vpc=vpc
)

role = iam.Role(self, "DBProxyRole", assumed_by=iam.AccountPrincipal(self.account))
proxy.grant_connect(role, "admin")
```

**Note**: In addition to the setup above, a database user will need to be created to support IAM auth.
See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html) for setup instructions.

To specify the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database
user use the `clientPasswordAuthType` property:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(
        version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_03_0
    ),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    vpc=vpc
)

proxy = rds.DatabaseProxy(self, "Proxy",
    proxy_target=rds.ProxyTarget.from_cluster(cluster),
    secrets=[cluster.secret],
    vpc=vpc,
    client_password_auth_type=rds.ClientPasswordAuthType.MYSQL_NATIVE_PASSWORD
)
```

### Cluster

The following example shows granting connection access for an IAM role to an Aurora Cluster.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(
        version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_03_0
    ),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    vpc=vpc
)
role = iam.Role(self, "AppRole", assumed_by=iam.ServicePrincipal("someservice.amazonaws.com"))
cluster.grant_connect(role, "somedbuser")
```

**Note**: In addition to the setup above, a database user will need to be created to support IAM auth.
See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html) for setup instructions.

## Kerberos Authentication

You can also authenticate using Kerberos to a database instance using AWS Managed Microsoft AD for authentication;
See [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/kerberos-authentication.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/kerberos-authentication.html) for more information
and a list of supported versions and limitations.

The following example shows enabling domain support for a database instance and creating an IAM role to access
Directory Services.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

role = iam.Role(self, "RDSDirectoryServicesRole",
    assumed_by=iam.CompositePrincipal(
        iam.ServicePrincipal("rds.amazonaws.com"),
        iam.ServicePrincipal("directoryservice.rds.amazonaws.com")),
    managed_policies=[
        iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("service-role/AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess")
    ]
)
instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.mysql(version=rds.MysqlEngineVersion.VER_8_0_19),
    vpc=vpc,
    domain="d-????????",  # The ID of the domain for the instance to join.
    domain_role=role
)
```

You can also use the Kerberos authentication for an Aurora database cluster.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

iam_role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.CompositePrincipal(
        iam.ServicePrincipal("rds.amazonaws.com"),
        iam.ServicePrincipal("directoryservice.rds.amazonaws.com")),
    managed_policies=[
        iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("service-role/AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess")
    ]
)

rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_05_1),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("Instance",
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.BURSTABLE3, ec2.InstanceSize.MEDIUM)
    ),
    vpc=vpc,
    domain="d-????????",  # The ID of the domain for the cluster to join.
    domain_role=iam_role
)
```

**Note**: In addition to the setup above, you need to make sure that the database instance or cluster has network connectivity
to the domain controllers. This includes enabling cross-VPC traffic if in a different VPC and setting up the
appropriate security groups/network ACL to allow traffic between the database instance and domain controllers.
Once configured, see [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/kerberos-authentication.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/kerberos-authentication.html) for details
on configuring users for each available database engine.

## Metrics

Database instances and clusters both expose metrics (`cloudwatch.Metric`):

```python
# The number of database connections in use (average over 5 minutes)
# instance: rds.DatabaseInstance

# Average CPU utilization over 5 minutes
# cluster: rds.DatabaseCluster

db_connections = instance.metric_database_connections()
cpu_utilization = cluster.metric_cPUUtilization()

# The average amount of time taken per disk I/O operation (average over 1 minute)
read_latency = instance.metric("ReadLatency", statistic="Average", period=Duration.seconds(60))
```

## Enabling S3 integration

Data in S3 buckets can be imported to and exported from certain database engines using SQL queries. To enable this
functionality, set the `s3ImportBuckets` and `s3ExportBuckets` properties for import and export respectively. When
configured, the CDK automatically creates and configures IAM roles as required.
Additionally, the `s3ImportRole` and `s3ExportRole` properties can be used to set this role directly.

You can read more about loading data to (or from) S3 here:

* Aurora MySQL - [import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.LoadFromS3.html)
  and [export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Integrating.SaveIntoS3.html).
* Aurora PostgreSQL - [import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Migrating.html#USER_PostgreSQL.S3Import)
  and [export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/postgresql-s3-export.html).
* Microsoft SQL Server - [import and export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.html)
* PostgreSQL - [import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/PostgreSQL.Procedural.Importing.html)
  and [export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/postgresql-s3-export.html)
* Oracle - [import and export](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-s3-integration.html)

The following snippet sets up a database cluster with different S3 buckets where the data is imported and exported -

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_s3 as s3

# vpc: ec2.Vpc

import_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "importbucket")
export_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "exportbucket")
rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "dbcluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora_mysql(
        version=rds.AuroraMysqlEngineVersion.VER_3_03_0
    ),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    vpc=vpc,
    s3_import_buckets=[import_bucket],
    s3_export_buckets=[export_bucket]
)
```

## Creating a Database Proxy

Amazon RDS Proxy sits between your application and your relational database to efficiently manage
connections to the database and improve scalability of the application. Learn more about at [Amazon RDS Proxy](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/).

RDS Proxy is supported for MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, and SQL Server.

The following code configures an RDS Proxy for a `DatabaseInstance`.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# security_group: ec2.SecurityGroup
# secrets: List[secretsmanager.Secret[]]
# db_instance: rds.DatabaseInstance


proxy = db_instance.add_proxy("proxy",
    borrow_timeout=Duration.seconds(30),
    max_connections_percent=50,
    secrets=secrets,
    vpc=vpc
)
```

## Exporting Logs

You can publish database logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. With CloudWatch Logs, you can perform real-time analysis of the log data,
store the data in highly durable storage, and manage the data with the CloudWatch Logs Agent. This is available for both database
instances and clusters; the types of logs available depend on the database type and engine being used.

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_logs as logs
# my_logs_publishing_role: iam.Role
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


# Exporting logs from a cluster
cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.aurora(
        version=rds.AuroraEngineVersion.VER_1_17_9
    ),
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("writer"),
    vpc=vpc,
    cloudwatch_logs_exports=["error", "general", "slowquery", "audit"],  # Export all available MySQL-based logs
    cloudwatch_logs_retention=logs.RetentionDays.THREE_MONTHS,  # Optional - default is to never expire logs
    cloudwatch_logs_retention_role=my_logs_publishing_role
)

# When 'cloudwatchLogsExports' is set, each export value creates its own log group in DB cluster.
# Specify an export value to access its log group.
error_log_group = cluster.cloudwatch_log_groups["error"]
audit_log_group = cluster.cloudwatch_log_groups.audit

# Exporting logs from an instance
instance = rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Instance",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.postgres(
        version=rds.PostgresEngineVersion.VER_16_3
    ),
    vpc=vpc,
    cloudwatch_logs_exports=["postgresql"],  # Export the PostgreSQL logs
    cloudwatch_logs_retention=logs.RetentionDays.THREE_MONTHS
)

# When 'cloudwatchLogsExports' is set, each export value creates its own log group in DB instance.
# Specify an export value to access its log group.
postgresql_log_group = instance.cloudwatch_log_groups["postgresql"]
```

## Option Groups

Some DB engines offer additional features that make it easier to manage data and databases, and to provide additional security for your database.
Amazon RDS uses option groups to enable and configure these features. An option group can specify features, called options,
that are available for a particular Amazon RDS DB instance.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# security_group: ec2.SecurityGroup


rds.OptionGroup(self, "Options",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.oracle_se2(
        version=rds.OracleEngineVersion.VER_19
    ),
    configurations=[rds.OptionConfiguration(
        name="OEM",
        port=5500,
        vpc=vpc,
        security_groups=[security_group]
    )
    ]
)
```

## Parameter Groups

Database parameters specify how the database is configured.
For example, database parameters can specify the amount of resources, such as memory, to allocate to a database.
You manage your database configuration by associating your DB instances with parameter groups.
Amazon RDS defines parameter groups with default settings.

You can create your own parameter group for your cluster or instance and associate it with your database:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


parameter_group = rds.ParameterGroup(self, "ParameterGroup",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.sql_server_ee(
        version=rds.SqlServerEngineVersion.VER_11
    ),
    name="my-parameter-group",
    parameters={
        "locks": "100"
    }
)

rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.SQL_SERVER_EE,
    vpc=vpc,
    parameter_group=parameter_group
)
```

Another way to specify parameters is to use the inline field `parameters` that creates an RDS parameter group for you.
You can use this if you do not want to reuse the parameter group instance for different instances:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


rds.DatabaseInstance(self, "Database",
    engine=rds.DatabaseInstanceEngine.sql_server_ee(version=rds.SqlServerEngineVersion.VER_11),
    vpc=vpc,
    parameters={
        "locks": "100"
    }
)
```

You cannot specify a parameter map and a parameter group at the same time.

## Serverless v1

[Amazon Aurora Serverless v1](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon
Aurora. The database will automatically start up, shut down, and scale capacity
up or down based on your application's needs. It enables you to run your database
in the cloud without managing any database instances.

The following example initializes an Aurora Serverless v1 PostgreSql cluster.
Aurora Serverless clusters can specify scaling properties which will be used to
automatically scale the database cluster seamlessly based on the workload.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc


cluster = rds.ServerlessCluster(self, "AnotherCluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA_POSTGRESQL,
    copy_tags_to_snapshot=True,  # whether to save the cluster tags when creating the snapshot. Default is 'true'
    parameter_group=rds.ParameterGroup.from_parameter_group_name(self, "ParameterGroup", "default.aurora-postgresql11"),
    vpc=vpc,
    scaling=rds.ServerlessScalingOptions(
        auto_pause=Duration.minutes(10),  # default is to pause after 5 minutes of idle time

    )
)
```

**Note**: The `rds.ServerlessCluster` class is for Aurora Serverless v1. If you want to use Aurora Serverless v2, use the `rds.DatabaseCluster` class.

Aurora Serverless v1 Clusters do not support the following features:

* Loading data from an Amazon S3 bucket
* Saving data to an Amazon S3 bucket
* Invoking an AWS Lambda function with an Aurora MySQL native function
* Aurora replicas
* Backtracking
* Multi-master clusters
* Database cloning
* IAM database cloning
* IAM database authentication
* Restoring a snapshot from MySQL DB instance
* Performance Insights
* RDS Proxy

Read more about the [limitations of Aurora Serverless v1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html#aurora-serverless.limitations)

Learn more about using Amazon Aurora Serverless v1 by reading the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html)

Use `ServerlessClusterFromSnapshot` to create a serverless cluster from a snapshot:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

rds.ServerlessClusterFromSnapshot(self, "Cluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA_MYSQL,
    vpc=vpc,
    snapshot_identifier="mySnapshot"
)
```

## Data API

You can access your Aurora DB cluster using the built-in Data API. The Data API doesn't require a persistent connection to the DB cluster. Instead, it provides a secure HTTP endpoint and integration with AWS SDKs.

The following example shows granting Data API access to a Lamba function.

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc
# fn: lambda.Function


# Create a serverless V1 cluster
serverless_v1_cluster = rds.ServerlessCluster(self, "AnotherCluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA_MYSQL,
    vpc=vpc,  # this parameter is optional for serverless Clusters
    enable_data_api=True
)
serverless_v1_cluster.grant_data_api_access(fn)

# Create an Aurora cluster
cluster = rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "Cluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA_MYSQL,
    vpc=vpc,
    enable_data_api=True
)
cluster.grant_data_api_access(fn)
```

**Note**: To invoke the Data API, the resource will need to read the secret associated with the cluster.

To learn more about using the Data API, see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html).

## Default VPC

The `vpc` parameter is optional.

If not provided, the cluster will be created in the default VPC of the account and region.
As this VPC is not deployed with AWS CDK, you can't configure the `vpcSubnets`, `subnetGroup` or `securityGroups` of the Aurora Serverless Cluster.
If you want to provide one of `vpcSubnets`, `subnetGroup` or `securityGroups` parameter, please provide a `vpc`.

## Preferred Maintenance Window

When creating an RDS cluster, it is possible to (optionally) specify a preferred maintenance window for the cluster as well as the instances under the cluster.
See [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#Concepts.DBMaintenance) for more information regarding maintenance windows.

The following code snippet shows an example of setting the cluster's maintenance window to 22:15-22:45 (UTC) on Saturdays, but setting the instances' maintenance window
to 23:15-23:45 on Sundays

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "DatabaseCluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA,
    instance_props=rds.InstanceProps(
        vpc=vpc,
        preferred_maintenance_window="Sun:23:15-Sun:23:45"
    ),
    preferred_maintenance_window="Sat:22:15-Sat:22:45"
)
```

You can also set the preferred maintenance window via reader and writer props:

```python
# vpc: ec2.Vpc

rds.DatabaseCluster(self, "DatabaseCluster",
    engine=rds.DatabaseClusterEngine.AURORA,
    vpc=vpc,
    writer=rds.ClusterInstance.provisioned("WriterInstance",
        preferred_maintenance_window="Sat:22:15-Sat:22:45"
    ),
    preferred_maintenance_window="Sat:22:15-Sat:22:45"
)
```

        :param engine_version: The name of your CEV. The name format is ``major version.customized_string`` . For example, a valid CEV name is ``19.my_cev1`` . This setting is required for RDS Custom for Oracle, but optional for Amazon RDS. The combination of ``Engine`` and ``EngineVersion`` is unique per customer per Region. *Constraints:* Minimum length is 1. Maximum length is 60. *Pattern:* ``^[a-z0-9_.-]{1,60$`` }
        :param database_installation_files_s3_bucket_name: The name of an Amazon S3 bucket that contains database installation files for your CEV. For example, a valid bucket name is ``my-custom-installation-files`` .

        :param description: An optional description of your CEV.
        :param image_id: A value that indicates the ID of the AMI.
        :param kms_key_id: The AWS KMS key identifier for an encrypted CEV. A symmetric encryption KMS key is required for RDS Custom, but optional for Amazon RDS. If you have an existing symmetric encryption KMS key in your account, you can use it with RDS Custom. No further action is necessary. If you don't already have a symmetric encryption KMS key in your account, follow the instructions in `Creating a symmetric encryption KMS key <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html#create-symmetric-cmk>`_ in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* . You can choose the same symmetric encryption key when you create a CEV and a DB instance, or choose different keys.
        :param manifest: The CEV manifest, which is a JSON document that describes the installation .zip files stored in Amazon S3. Specify the name/value pairs in a file or a quoted string. RDS Custom applies the patches in the order in which they are listed. The following JSON fields are valid: - **MediaImportTemplateVersion** - Version of the CEV manifest. The date is in the format ``YYYY-MM-DD`` . - **databaseInstallationFileNames** - Ordered list of installation files for the CEV. - **opatchFileNames** - Ordered list of OPatch installers used for the Oracle DB engine. - **psuRuPatchFileNames** - The PSU and RU patches for this CEV. - **OtherPatchFileNames** - The patches that are not in the list of PSU and RU patches. Amazon RDS applies these patches after applying the PSU and RU patches. For more information, see `Creating the CEV manifest <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html#custom-cev.preparing.manifest>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* .
        :param source_custom_db_engine_version_identifier: The ARN of a CEV to use as a source for creating a new CEV. You can specify a different Amazon Machine Imagine (AMI) by using either ``Source`` or ``UseAwsProvidedLatestImage`` . You can't specify a different JSON manifest when you specify ``SourceCustomDbEngineVersionIdentifier`` .
        :param status: A value that indicates the status of a custom engine version (CEV). Default: - "available"
        :param tags: A list of tags. For more information, see `Tagging Amazon RDS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
        :param use_aws_provided_latest_image: Specifies whether to use the latest service-provided Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the CEV. If you specify ``UseAwsProvidedLatestImage`` , you can't also specify ``ImageId`` .

    For more information about creating a Multi-AZ DB cluster, see `Creating a Multi-AZ DB cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/create-multi-az-db-cluster.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* .
    .. epigraph::

       You can only create this resource in AWS Regions where Amazon Aurora or Multi-AZ DB clusters are supported.

    *Updating DB clusters*

    When properties labeled " *Update requires:* `Replacement <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement>`_ " are updated, AWS CloudFormation first creates a replacement DB cluster, then changes references from other dependent resources to point to the replacement DB cluster, and finally deletes the old DB cluster.
    .. epigraph::

       We highly recommend that you take a snapshot of the database before updating the stack. If you don't, you lose the data when AWS CloudFormation replaces your DB cluster. To preserve your data, perform the following procedure:

       - Deactivate any applications that are using the DB cluster so that there's no activity on the DB instance.
       - Create a snapshot of the DB cluster. For more information, see `Creating a DB Cluster Snapshot <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshotCluster.html>`_ .
       - If you want to restore your DB cluster using a DB cluster snapshot, modify the updated template with your DB cluster changes and add the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property with the ID of the DB cluster snapshot that you want to use.

       After you restore a DB cluster with a ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the DB cluster snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB cluster is restored from the specified ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB cluster is deleted.

       - Update the stack.

    Currently, when you are updating the stack for an Aurora Serverless DB cluster, you can't include changes to any other properties when you specify one of the following properties: ``PreferredBackupWindow`` , ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow`` , and ``Port`` . This limitation doesn't apply to provisioned DB clusters.

    For more information about updating other properties of this resource, see ``[ModifyDBCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBCluster.html)`` . For more information about updating stacks, see `AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html>`_ .

    *Deleting DB clusters*

    The default ``DeletionPolicy`` for ``AWS::RDS::DBCluster`` resources is ``Snapshot`` . For more information about how AWS CloudFormation deletes resources, see `DeletionPolicy Attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html>`_ .

To see the time blocks available, see `Adjusting the Preferred DB Cluster Maintenance Window <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow.Aurora>`_ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide.* Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun. Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param publicly_accessible: Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible. When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified. If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` isn't specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies: - If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public. If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies: - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
        :param replication_source_identifier: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB instance or DB cluster if this DB cluster is created as a read replica. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
        :param restore_to_time: The date and time to restore the DB cluster to. Valid Values: Value must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format Constraints: - Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance - Must be specified if ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter isn't provided - Can't be specified if the ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter is enabled - Can't be specified if the ``RestoreType`` parameter is ``copy-on-write`` This property must be used with ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` property. The resulting cluster will have the identifier that matches the value of the ``DBclusterIdentifier`` property. Example: ``2015-03-07T23:45:00Z`` Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param restore_type: The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:. - ``full-copy`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster. - ``copy-on-write`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster. If you don't specify a ``RestoreType`` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters Default: - "full-copy"
        :param scaling_configuration: The scaling configuration of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. This property is only supported for Aurora Serverless v1. For Aurora Serverless v2, Use the ``ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration`` property. Valid for: Aurora Serverless v1 DB clusters only
        :param serverless_v2_scaling_configuration: The scaling configuration of an Aurora Serverless V2 DB cluster. This property is only supported for Aurora Serverless v2. For Aurora Serverless v1, Use the ``ScalingConfiguration`` property. Valid for: Aurora Serverless v2 DB clusters only
        :param snapshot_identifier: The identifier for the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from. You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB snapshot. After you restore a DB cluster with a ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB cluster is restored from the specified ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB cluster (as opposed to specifying it for DB cluster updates), then don't specify the following properties: - ``GlobalClusterIdentifier`` - ``MasterUsername`` - ``MasterUserPassword`` - ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` - ``RestoreType`` - ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` - ``SourceRegion`` - ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an encrypted snapshot) - ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` Constraints: - Must match the identifier of an existing Snapshot. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param source_db_cluster_identifier: When restoring a DB cluster to a point in time, the identifier of the source DB cluster from which to restore. Constraints: - Must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param source_region: The AWS Region which contains the source DB cluster when replicating a DB cluster. For example, ``us-east-1`` . Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only
        :param storage_encrypted: Indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted. If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption. If you specify the ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB cluster, and if the DB cluster is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot is encrypted, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot, and the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot isn't encrypted, you can use this property to specify that the restored DB cluster is encrypted. Specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property for the KMS key to use for encryption. If you don't want the restored DB cluster to be encrypted, then don't set this property or set it to ``false`` . .. epigraph:: If you specify both the ``StorageEncrypted`` and ``SnapshotIdentifier`` properties without specifying the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then the restored DB cluster inherits the encryption settings from the DB snapshot that provide. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param storage_type: The storage type to associate with the DB cluster. For information on storage types for Aurora DB clusters, see `Storage configurations for Amazon Aurora DB clusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.StorageReliability.html#aurora-storage-type>`_ . For information on storage types for Multi-AZ DB clusters, see `Settings for creating Multi-AZ DB clusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/create-multi-az-db-cluster.html#create-multi-az-db-cluster-settings>`_ . This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster. When specified for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a value for the ``Iops`` parameter is required. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters Valid Values: - Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora | aurora-iopt1`` - Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1 | io2 | gp3`` Default: - Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora`` - Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1`` .. epigraph:: When you create an Aurora DB cluster with the storage type set to ``aurora-iopt1`` , the storage type is returned in the response. The storage type isn't returned when you set it to ``aurora`` .
        :param tags: An optional array of key-value pairs to apply to this DB cluster. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param use_latest_restorable_time: A value that indicates whether to restore the DB cluster to the latest restorable backup time. By default, the DB cluster is not restored to the latest restorable backup time. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param vpc_security_group_ids: A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB cluster. If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are ``1`` , ``2`` , ``4`` , ``8`` , ``16`` , ``32`` , ``64`` , ``128`` , and ``256`` . For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are ``2`` , ``4`` , ``8`` , ``16`` , ``32`` , ``64`` , ``192`` , and ``384`` . The maximum capacity must be greater than or equal to the minimum capacity.
            :param min_capacity: The minimum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in ``serverless`` DB engine mode.

With this parameter enabled, a secondary cluster can forward writes to the current primary cluster, and the resulting changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this value is used immediately if the primary is demoted by a global cluster API operation, but it does nothing until then. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only
        :param enable_http_endpoint: Specifies whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for the DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint isn't enabled. When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web service API (RDS Data API) for running SQL queries on the DB cluster.

Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param publicly_accessible: Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible. When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified. If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` isn't specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies: - If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. - If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public. If ``DBSubnetGroupName`` is specified, and ``PubliclyAccessible`` isn't specified, the following applies: - If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private. - If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

The resulting cluster will have the identifier that matches the value of the ``DBclusterIdentifier`` property. Example: ``2015-03-07T23:45:00Z`` Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param restore_type: The type of restore to be performed. You can specify one of the following values:. - ``full-copy`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster. - ``copy-on-write`` - The new DB cluster is restored as a clone of the source DB cluster. If you don't specify a ``RestoreType`` value, then the new DB cluster is restored as a full copy of the source DB cluster.

        :param snapshot_identifier: The identifier for the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from. You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB snapshot. After you restore a DB cluster with a ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from the snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB cluster is restored from the specified ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB cluster is deleted. If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB cluster (as opposed to specifying it for DB cluster updates), then don't specify the following properties: - ``GlobalClusterIdentifier`` - ``MasterUsername`` - ``MasterUserPassword`` - ``ReplicationSourceIdentifier`` - ``RestoreType`` - ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` - ``SourceRegion`` - ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an encrypted snapshot) - ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` Constraints: - Must match the identifier of an existing Snapshot.

        :param storage_encrypted: Indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted. If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption. If you specify the ``SourceDBClusterIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB cluster, and if the DB cluster is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot is encrypted, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot, and the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot isn't encrypted, you can use this property to specify that the restored DB cluster is encrypted. Specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property for the KMS key to use for encryption. If you don't want the restored DB cluster to be encrypted, then don't set this property or set it to ``false`` . .. epigraph:: If you specify both the ``StorageEncrypted`` and ``SnapshotIdentifier`` properties without specifying the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then the restored DB cluster inherits the encryption settings from the DB snapshot that provide. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param storage_type: The storage type to associate with the DB cluster. For information on storage types for Aurora DB clusters, see `Storage configurations for Amazon Aurora DB clusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.StorageReliability.html#aurora-storage-type>`_ . For information on storage types for Multi-AZ DB clusters, see `Settings for creating Multi-AZ DB clusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/create-multi-az-db-cluster.html#create-multi-az-db-cluster-settings>`_ . This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster. When specified for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a value for the ``Iops`` parameter is required. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters Valid Values: - Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora | aurora-iopt1`` - Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1 | io2 | gp3`` Default: - Aurora DB clusters - ``aurora`` - Multi-AZ DB clusters - ``io1`` .. epigraph:: When you create an Aurora DB cluster with the storage type set to ``aurora-iopt1`` , the storage type is returned in the response. The storage type isn't returned when you set it to ``aurora`` .
        :param tags: An optional array of key-value pairs to apply to this DB cluster. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param use_latest_restorable_time: A value that indicates whether to restore the DB cluster to the latest restorable backup time. By default, the DB cluster is not restored to the latest restorable backup time. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
        :param vpc_security_group_ids: A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with this DB cluster. If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC. Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

        If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot is encrypted, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot, and the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used.

        If you specify the ``SnapshotIdentifier`` and the specified snapshot isn't encrypted, you can use this property to specify that the restored DB cluster is encrypted. Specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property for the KMS key to use for encryption. If you don't want the restored DB cluster to be encrypted, then don't set this property or set it to ``false`` .
        .. epigraph::

           If you specify both the ``StorageEncrypted`` and ``SnapshotIdentifier`` properties without specifying the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then the restored DB cluster inherits the encryption settings from the DB snapshot that provide.

    '''The ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` resource creates an Amazon DB instance.

    The new DB instance can be an RDS DB instance, or it can be a DB instance in an Aurora DB cluster.

    For more information about creating an RDS DB instance, see `Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* .

    For more information about creating a DB instance in an Aurora DB cluster, see `Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html>`_ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* .

    If you import an existing DB instance, and the template configuration doesn't match the actual configuration of the DB instance, AWS CloudFormation applies the changes in the template during the import operation.
    .. epigraph::

       If a DB instance is deleted or replaced during an update, AWS CloudFormation deletes all automated snapshots. However, it retains manual DB snapshots. During an update that requires replacement, you can apply a stack policy to prevent DB instances from being replaced. For more information, see `Prevent Updates to Stack Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/protect-stack-resources.html>`_ .

    *Updating DB instances*

    When properties labeled " *Update requires:* `Replacement <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-update-behaviors.html#update-replacement>`_ " are updated, AWS CloudFormation first creates a replacement DB instance, then changes references from other dependent resources to point to the replacement DB instance, and finally deletes the old DB instance.
    .. epigraph::

       We highly recommend that you take a snapshot of the database before updating the stack. If you don't, you lose the data when AWS CloudFormation replaces your DB instance. To preserve your data, perform the following procedure:

       - Deactivate any applications that are using the DB instance so that there's no activity on the DB instance.
       - Create a snapshot of the DB instance. For more information, see `Creating a DB Snapshot <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshot.html>`_ .
       - If you want to restore your instance using a DB snapshot, modify the updated template with your DB instance changes and add the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property with the ID of the DB snapshot that you want to use.

       After you restore a DB instance with a ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, you can delete the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property. When you specify this property for an update, the DB instance is not restored from the DB snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB instance is created, and the original DB instance is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB instance is restored from the specified ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB instance is deleted.

       - Update the stack.

    For more information about updating other properties of this resource, see ``[ModifyDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBInstance.html)`` . For more information about updating stacks, see `AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html>`_ .

    *Deleting DB instances*

    For DB instances that are part of an Aurora DB cluster, you can set a deletion policy for your DB instance to control how AWS CloudFormation handles the DB instance when the stack is deleted. For Amazon RDS DB instances, you can choose to *retain* the DB instance, to *delete* the DB instance, or to *create a snapshot* of the DB instance. The default AWS CloudFormation behavior depends on the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` property:

    - For ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` resources that don't specify the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation saves a snapshot of the DB instance.
    - For ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` resources that do specify the ``DBClusterIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation deletes the DB instance.

    For more information, see `DeletionPolicy Attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html>`_ .

        :param db_instance_identifier: A name for the DB instance. If you specify a name, AWS CloudFormation converts it to lowercase. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the DB instance. For more information, see `Name Type <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-name.html>`_ . For information about constraints that apply to DB instance identifiers, see `Naming constraints in Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Constraints>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . .. epigraph:: If you specify a name, you can't perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param db_name: The meaning of this parameter differs according to the database engine you use. .. epigraph:: If you specify the ``[DBSnapshotIdentifier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsnapshotidentifier)`` property, this property only applies to RDS for Oracle. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable.

        :param db_parameter_group_name: The name of an existing DB parameter group or a reference to an `AWS::RDS::DBParameterGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-dbparametergroup.html>`_ resource created in the template. To list all of the available DB parameter group names, use the following command: ``aws rds describe-db-parameter-groups --query "DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName" --output text`` .. epigraph:: If any of the data members of the referenced parameter group are changed during an update, the DB instance might need to be restarted, which causes some interruption. If the parameter group contains static parameters, whether they were changed or not, an update triggers a reboot. If you don't specify a value for ``DBParameterGroupName`` property, the default DB parameter group for the specified engine and engine version is used.
        :param db_security_groups: A list of the DB security groups to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the name of existing DB security groups or references to AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroup resources created in the template. If you set DBSecurityGroups, you must not set VPCSecurityGroups, and vice versa. Also, note that the DBSecurityGroups property exists only for backwards compatibility with older regions and is no longer recommended for providing security information to an RDS DB instance. Instead, use VPCSecurityGroups. .. epigraph:: If you specify this property, AWS CloudFormation sends only the following properties (if specified) to Amazon RDS during create operations: - ``AllocatedStorage`` - ``AutoMinorVersionUpgrade`` - ``AvailabilityZone`` - ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` - ``CharacterSetName`` - ``DBInstanceClass`` - ``DBName`` - ``DBParameterGroupName`` - ``DBSecurityGroups`` - ``DBSubnetGroupName`` - ``Engine`` - ``EngineVersion`` - ``Iops`` - ``LicenseModel`` - ``MasterUsername`` - ``MasterUserPassword`` - ``MultiAZ`` - ``OptionGroupName`` - ``PreferredBackupWindow`` - ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow`` All other properties are ignored. Specify a virtual private cloud (VPC) security group if you want to submit other properties, such as ``StorageType`` , ``StorageEncrypted`` , or ``KmsKeyId`` . If you're already using the ``DBSecurityGroups`` property, you can't use these other properties by updating your DB instance to use a VPC security group. You must recreate the DB instance.
        :param db_snapshot_identifier: The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DB snapshot that's used to restore the DB instance. If you're restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, you must specify the ARN of the snapshot. By specifying this property, you can create a DB instance from the specified DB snapshot. If the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property is an empty string or the ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` declaration has no ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation creates a new database. If the property contains a value (other than an empty string), AWS CloudFormation creates a database from the specified snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified name doesn't exist, AWS CloudFormation can't create the database and it rolls back the stack. Some DB instance properties aren't valid when you restore from a snapshot, such as the ``MasterUsername`` and ``MasterUserPassword`` properties. For information about the properties that you can specify, see the ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot`` action in the *Amazon RDS API Reference* . After you restore a DB instance with a ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB instance. When you specify this property for an update, the DB instance is not restored from the DB snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB instance is created, and the original DB instance is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB instance is restored from the specified ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB instance is deleted. If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB instance (as opposed to specifying it for DB instance updates), then don't specify the following properties: - ``CharacterSetName`` - ``DBClusterIdentifier`` - ``DBName`` - ``DeleteAutomatedBackups`` - ``EnablePerformanceInsights`` - ``KmsKeyId`` - ``MasterUsername`` - ``MasterUserPassword`` - ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` - ``PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod`` - ``PromotionTier`` - ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` - ``SourceRegion`` - ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an encrypted snapshot) - ``Timezone`` *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. Snapshot restore is managed by the DB cluster.
        :param db_subnet_group_name: A DB subnet group to associate with the DB instance. If you update this value, the new subnet group must be a subnet group in a new VPC. If there's no DB subnet group, then the DB instance isn't a VPC DB instance. For more information about using Amazon RDS in a VPC, see `Using Amazon RDS with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The DB subnet group is managed by the DB cluster. If specified, the setting must match the DB cluster setting.
        :param dedicated_log_volume: Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV) enabled.
        :param delete_automated_backups: A value that indicates whether to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. The default is to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the DB cluster are not deleted.
        :param deletion_protection: A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled. For more information, see `Deleting a DB Instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html>`_ . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. You can enable or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster. For more information, see ``CreateDBCluster`` . DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB cluster.
        :param domain: The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Currently, only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

        :param engine: The name of the database engine to use for this DB instance. Not every database engine is available in every AWS Region. This property is required when creating a DB instance. .. epigraph:: You can convert an Oracle database from the non-CDB architecture to the container database (CDB) architecture by updating the ``Engine`` value in your templates from ``oracle-ee`` to ``oracle-ee-cdb`` or from ``oracle-se2`` to ``oracle-se2-cdb`` . Converting to the CDB architecture requires an interruption. Valid Values: - ``aurora-mysql`` (for Aurora MySQL DB instances) - ``aurora-postgresql`` (for Aurora PostgreSQL DB instances) - ``custom-oracle-ee`` (for RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances) - ``custom-oracle-ee-cdb`` (for RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances) - ``custom-sqlserver-ee`` (for RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances) - ``custom-sqlserver-se`` (for RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances) - ``custom-sqlserver-web`` (for RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances) - ``db2-ae`` - ``db2-se`` - ``mariadb`` - ``mysql`` - ``oracle-ee`` - ``oracle-ee-cdb`` - ``oracle-se2`` - ``oracle-se2-cdb`` - ``postgres`` - ``sqlserver-ee`` - ``sqlserver-se`` - ``sqlserver-ex`` - ``sqlserver-web``
        :param engine_version: The version number of the database engine to use. For a list of valid engine versions, use the ``DescribeDBEngineVersions`` action. The following are the database engines and links to information about the major and minor versions that are available with Amazon RDS. Not every database engine is available for every AWS Region. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The version number of the database engine to be used by the DB instance is managed by the DB cluster. *Db2* See `Amazon RDS for Db2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Db2.html#Db2.Concepts.VersionMgmt>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *MariaDB* See `MariaDB on Amazon RDS Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MariaDB.html#MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *Microsoft SQL Server* See `Microsoft SQL Server Versions on Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.VersionSupport>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *MySQL* See `MySQL on Amazon RDS Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *Oracle* See `Oracle Database Engine Release Notes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.PatchComposition.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *PostgreSQL* See `Supported PostgreSQL Database Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.DBVersions>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
        :param iops: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the database provisions. The value must be equal to or greater than 1000. If you specify this property, you must follow the range of allowed ratios of your requested IOPS rate to the amount of storage that you allocate (IOPS to allocated storage). For example, you can provision an Oracle database instance with 1000 IOPS and 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 5:1), or specify 2000 IOPS with 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 10:1). For more information, see `Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . .. epigraph:: If you specify ``io1`` for the ``StorageType`` property, then you must also specify the ``Iops`` property. Constraints: - For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL - Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance. - For RDS for SQL Server - Must be a multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.

If you enable the StorageEncrypted property but don't specify this property, AWS CloudFormation uses the default KMS key. If you specify this property, you must set the StorageEncrypted property to true. If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property, the value is inherited from the source DB instance if the read replica is created in the same region. If you create an encrypted read replica in a different AWS Region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they're created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one region in another region. If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The ``StorageEncrypted`` property value is inherited from the snapshot. If the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is also inherited from the snapshot. If you specify ``DBSecurityGroups`` , AWS CloudFormation ignores this property. To specify both a security group and this property, you must use a VPC security group. For more information about Amazon RDS and VPC, see `Using Amazon RDS with Amazon VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable.

For more information, see `Password management with AWS Secrets Manager <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
        :param max_allocated_storage: The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see `Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances: - Amazon Aurora (Storage is managed by the DB cluster.) - RDS Custom
        :param monitoring_interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. If ``MonitoringRoleArn`` is specified, then you must set ``MonitoringInterval`` to a value other than 0.

If ``MonitoringInterval`` is set to a value other than ``0`` , then you must supply a ``MonitoringRoleArn`` value. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param multi_az: Specifies whether the database instance is a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. You can't set the ``AvailabilityZone`` parameter if the ``MultiAZ`` parameter is set to true. For more information, see `Multi-AZ deployments for high availability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. Amazon Aurora storage is replicated across all of the Availability Zones and doesn't require the ``MultiAZ`` option to be set.
        :param nchar_character_set_name: The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param network_type: The network type of the DB instance. Valid values: - ``IPV4`` - ``DUAL`` The network type is determined by the ``DBSubnetGroup`` specified for the DB instance. A ``DBSubnetGroup`` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols ( ``DUAL`` ). For more information, see `Working with a DB instance in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
        :param option_group_name: Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified option group. Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group. Also, that option group can't be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with a DB instance.
        :param performance_insights_kms_key_id: The AWS KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you do not specify a value for ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` , then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default KMS key for each AWS Region. For information about enabling Performance Insights, see `EnablePerformanceInsights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-enableperformanceinsights>`_ .
        :param performance_insights_retention_period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: - ``7`` - *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: ``93`` (3 months * 31), ``341`` (11 months * 31), ``589`` (19 months * 31) - ``731`` Default: ``7`` days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as ``94`` , Amazon RDS returns an error.
        :param port: The port number on which the database accepts connections. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The port number is managed by the DB cluster. *Db2* Default value: ``50000``
        :param preferred_backup_window: The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, using the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` parameter. For more information, see `Backup Window <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* Constraints: - Must be in the format ``hh24:mi-hh24:mi`` . - Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). - Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window. - Must be at least 30 minutes. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster.
        :param preferred_maintenance_window: The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Format: ``ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`` The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week. To see the time blocks available, see `Adjusting the Preferred DB Instance Maintenance Window <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* .. epigraph:: This property applies when AWS CloudFormation initially creates the DB instance. If you use AWS CloudFormation to update the DB instance, those updates are applied immediately. Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.
        :param processor_features: The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param promotion_tier: The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see `Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.AuroraHighAvailability.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance>`_ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* . This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Default: ``1`` Valid Values: ``0 - 15`` Default: - 1
        :param publicly_accessible: Indicates whether the DB instance is an internet-facing instance. If you specify true, AWS CloudFormation creates an instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. If you specify false, AWS CloudFormation creates an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. The default behavior value depends on your VPC setup and the database subnet group. For more information, see the ``PubliclyAccessible`` parameter in the `CreateDBInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS API Reference* .
        :param replica_mode: The open mode of an Oracle read replica. For more information, see `Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . This setting is only supported in RDS for Oracle. Default: ``open-read-only`` Valid Values: ``open-read-only`` or ``mounted``
        :param restore_time: The date and time to restore from. Constraints: - Must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format. - Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance. - Can't be specified if the ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter is enabled. Example: ``2009-09-07T23:45:00Z``
        :param source_db_cluster_identifier: The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas. Constraints: - Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster. - Can't be specified if the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` parameter is also specified. - The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0. - The source DB cluster must be in the same AWS Region as the read replica. Cross-Region replication isn't supported.
        :param source_db_instance_automated_backups_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replicated automated backups from which to restore, for example, ``arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEXAMPLE`` . This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
        :param source_db_instance_identifier: If you want to create a read replica DB instance, specify the ID of the source DB instance. Each DB instance can have a limited number of read replicas. For more information, see `Working with Read Replicas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . For information about constraints that apply to DB instance identifiers, see `Naming constraints in Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Constraints>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . The ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property determines whether a DB instance is a read replica. If you remove the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property from your template and then update your stack, AWS CloudFormation promotes the Read Replica to a standalone DB instance. .. epigraph:: - If you specify a source DB instance that uses VPC security groups, we recommend that you specify the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property. If you don't specify the property, the read replica inherits the value of the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property from the source DB when you create the replica. However, if you update the stack, AWS CloudFormation reverts the replica's ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property to the default value because it's not defined in the stack's template. This change might cause unexpected issues. - Read replicas don't support deletion policies. AWS CloudFormation ignores any deletion policy that's associated with a read replica. - If you specify ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` , don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property. You can't create a read replica from a snapshot. - Don't set the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` , ``DBName`` , ``MasterUsername`` , ``MasterUserPassword`` , and ``PreferredBackupWindow`` properties. The database attributes are inherited from the source DB instance, and backups are disabled for read replicas. - If the source DB instance is in a different region than the read replica, specify the source region in ``SourceRegion`` , and specify an ARN for a valid DB instance in ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` . For more information, see `Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#USER_Tagging.ARN>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . - For DB instances in Amazon Aurora clusters, don't specify this property. Amazon RDS automatically assigns writer and reader DB instances.
        :param source_dbi_resource_id: The resource ID of the source DB instance from which to restore.
        :param source_region: The ID of the region that contains the source DB instance for the read replica.
        :param storage_encrypted: A value that indicates whether the DB instance is encrypted. By default, it isn't encrypted. If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption. If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance, and if the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. If you specify ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB cluster.
        :param storage_throughput: Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting applies only to the ``gp3`` storage type. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.
        :param storage_type: The storage type to associate with the DB instance. If you specify ``io1`` , ``io2`` , or ``gp3`` , you must also include a value for the ``Iops`` parameter. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster. Valid Values: ``gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard`` Default: ``io1`` , if the ``Iops`` parameter is specified. Otherwise, ``gp2`` .
        :param tags: An optional array of key-value pairs to apply to this DB instance.
        :param tde_credential_arn: 
        :param tde_credential_password: 
        :param timezone: The time zone of the DB instance. The time zone parameter is currently supported only by `RDS for Db2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-time-zone>`_ and `RDS for SQL Server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.TimeZone>`_ .
        :param use_default_processor_features: Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param use_latest_restorable_time: Specifies whether the DB instance is restored from the latest backup time. By default, the DB instance isn't restored from the latest backup time. Constraints: - Can't be specified if the ``RestoreTime`` parameter is provided.
        :param vpc_security_groups: A list of the VPC security group IDs to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the physical IDs of existing VPC security groups and references to `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html>`_ resources created in the template. If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC. If you set ``VPCSecurityGroups`` , you must not set ```DBSecurityGroups`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups>`_ , and vice versa. .. epigraph:: You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but keep the following in mind: - You can't revert to using an RDS security group after you establish a VPC security group membership. - When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack update rolls back because the DB instance update fails or because an update fails in another AWS CloudFormation resource, the rollback fails because it can't revert to an RDS security group. - To use the properties that are available when you use a VPC security group, you must recreate the DB instance. If you don't, AWS CloudFormation submits only the property values that are listed in the ```DBSecurityGroups`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups>`_ property. To avoid this situation, migrate your DB instance to using VPC security groups only when that is the only change in your stack template. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. If specified, the setting must match the DB cluster setting.

        :param db_instance_identifier: A name for the DB instance. If you specify a name, AWS CloudFormation converts it to lowercase. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the DB instance. For more information, see `Name Type <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-name.html>`_ . For information about constraints that apply to DB instance identifiers, see `Naming constraints in Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Constraints>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . .. epigraph:: If you specify a name, you can't perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you must replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param db_name: The meaning of this parameter differs according to the database engine you use. .. epigraph:: If you specify the ``[DBSnapshotIdentifier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsnapshotidentifier)`` property, this property only applies to RDS for Oracle. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable.

        :param db_parameter_group_name: The name of an existing DB parameter group or a reference to an `AWS::RDS::DBParameterGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-dbparametergroup.html>`_ resource created in the template. To list all of the available DB parameter group names, use the following command: ``aws rds describe-db-parameter-groups --query "DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName" --output text`` .. epigraph:: If any of the data members of the referenced parameter group are changed during an update, the DB instance might need to be restarted, which causes some interruption. If the parameter group contains static parameters, whether they were changed or not, an update triggers a reboot. If you don't specify a value for ``DBParameterGroupName`` property, the default DB parameter group for the specified engine and engine version is used.
        :param db_security_groups: A list of the DB security groups to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the name of existing DB security groups or references to AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroup resources created in the template. If you set DBSecurityGroups, you must not set VPCSecurityGroups, and vice versa. Also, note that the DBSecurityGroups property exists only for backwards compatibility with older regions and is no longer recommended for providing security information to an RDS DB instance. Instead, use VPCSecurityGroups. .. epigraph:: If you specify this property, AWS CloudFormation sends only the following properties (if specified) to Amazon RDS during create operations: - ``AllocatedStorage`` - ``AutoMinorVersionUpgrade`` - ``AvailabilityZone`` - ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` - ``CharacterSetName`` - ``DBInstanceClass`` - ``DBName`` - ``DBParameterGroupName`` - ``DBSecurityGroups`` - ``DBSubnetGroupName`` - ``Engine`` - ``EngineVersion`` - ``Iops`` - ``LicenseModel`` - ``MasterUsername`` - ``MasterUserPassword`` - ``MultiAZ`` - ``OptionGroupName`` - ``PreferredBackupWindow`` - ``PreferredMaintenanceWindow`` All other properties are ignored. Specify a virtual private cloud (VPC) security group if you want to submit other properties, such as ``StorageType`` , ``StorageEncrypted`` , or ``KmsKeyId`` . If you're already using the ``DBSecurityGroups`` property, you can't use these other properties by updating your DB instance to use a VPC security group. You must recreate the DB instance.
        :param db_snapshot_identifier: The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DB snapshot that's used to restore the DB instance. If you're restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, you must specify the ARN of the snapshot. By specifying this property, you can create a DB instance from the specified DB snapshot. If the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property is an empty string or the ``AWS::RDS::DBInstance`` declaration has no ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, AWS CloudFormation creates a new database. If the property contains a value (other than an empty string), AWS CloudFormation creates a database from the specified snapshot. If a snapshot with the specified name doesn't exist, AWS CloudFormation can't create the database and it rolls back the stack. Some DB instance properties aren't valid when you restore from a snapshot, such as the ``MasterUsername`` and ``MasterUserPassword`` properties. For information about the properties that you can specify, see the ``RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot`` action in the *Amazon RDS API Reference* . After you restore a DB instance with a ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, you must specify the same ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property for any future updates to the DB instance. When you specify this property for an update, the DB instance is not restored from the DB snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed. However, if you don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, an empty DB instance is created, and the original DB instance is deleted. If you specify a property that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new DB instance is restored from the specified ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, and the original DB instance is deleted. If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property to restore a DB instance (as opposed to specifying it for DB instance updates), then don't specify the following properties: - ``CharacterSetName`` - ``DBClusterIdentifier`` - ``DBName`` - ``DeleteAutomatedBackups`` - ``EnablePerformanceInsights`` - ``KmsKeyId`` - ``MasterUsername`` - ``MasterUserPassword`` - ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` - ``PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod`` - ``PromotionTier`` - ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` - ``SourceRegion`` - ``StorageEncrypted`` (for an encrypted snapshot) - ``Timezone`` *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. Snapshot restore is managed by the DB cluster.
        :param db_subnet_group_name: A DB subnet group to associate with the DB instance. If you update this value, the new subnet group must be a subnet group in a new VPC. If there's no DB subnet group, then the DB instance isn't a VPC DB instance. For more information about using Amazon RDS in a VPC, see `Using Amazon RDS with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The DB subnet group is managed by the DB cluster. If specified, the setting must match the DB cluster setting.
        :param dedicated_log_volume: Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV) enabled.
        :param delete_automated_backups: A value that indicates whether to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted. This parameter isn't case-sensitive. The default is to remove automated backups immediately after the DB instance is deleted. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. When you delete a DB cluster, all automated backups for that DB cluster are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB cluster snapshots of the DB cluster are not deleted.
        :param deletion_protection: A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protection enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled. For more information, see `Deleting a DB Instance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html>`_ . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. You can enable or disable deletion protection for the DB cluster. For more information, see ``CreateDBCluster`` . DB instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion protection is enabled for the DB cluster.
        :param domain: The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Currently, only Db2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

        :param engine: The name of the database engine to use for this DB instance. Not every database engine is available in every AWS Region. This property is required when creating a DB instance. .. epigraph:: You can convert an Oracle database from the non-CDB architecture to the container database (CDB) architecture by updating the ``Engine`` value in your templates from ``oracle-ee`` to ``oracle-ee-cdb`` or from ``oracle-se2`` to ``oracle-se2-cdb`` . Converting to the CDB architecture requires an interruption. Valid Values: - ``aurora-mysql`` (for Aurora MySQL DB instances) - ``aurora-postgresql`` (for Aurora PostgreSQL DB instances) - ``custom-oracle-ee`` (for RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances) - ``custom-oracle-ee-cdb`` (for RDS Custom for Oracle DB instances) - ``custom-sqlserver-ee`` (for RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances) - ``custom-sqlserver-se`` (for RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances) - ``custom-sqlserver-web`` (for RDS Custom for SQL Server DB instances) - ``db2-ae`` - ``db2-se`` - ``mariadb`` - ``mysql`` - ``oracle-ee`` - ``oracle-ee-cdb`` - ``oracle-se2`` - ``oracle-se2-cdb`` - ``postgres`` - ``sqlserver-ee`` - ``sqlserver-se`` - ``sqlserver-ex`` - ``sqlserver-web``
        :param engine_version: The version number of the database engine to use. For a list of valid engine versions, use the ``DescribeDBEngineVersions`` action. The following are the database engines and links to information about the major and minor versions that are available with Amazon RDS. Not every database engine is available for every AWS Region. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The version number of the database engine to be used by the DB instance is managed by the DB cluster. *Db2* See `Amazon RDS for Db2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Db2.html#Db2.Concepts.VersionMgmt>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *MariaDB* See `MariaDB on Amazon RDS Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MariaDB.html#MariaDB.Concepts.VersionMgmt>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *Microsoft SQL Server* See `Microsoft SQL Server Versions on Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.VersionSupport>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *MySQL* See `MySQL on Amazon RDS Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *Oracle* See `Oracle Database Engine Release Notes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.PatchComposition.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* *PostgreSQL* See `Supported PostgreSQL Database Versions <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.DBVersions>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
        :param iops: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the database provisions. The value must be equal to or greater than 1000. If you specify this property, you must follow the range of allowed ratios of your requested IOPS rate to the amount of storage that you allocate (IOPS to allocated storage). For example, you can provision an Oracle database instance with 1000 IOPS and 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 5:1), or specify 2000 IOPS with 200 GiB of storage (a ratio of 10:1). For more information, see `Amazon RDS Provisioned IOPS Storage to Improve Performance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/CHAP_Storage.html#USER_PIOPS>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . .. epigraph:: If you specify ``io1`` for the ``StorageType`` property, then you must also specify the ``Iops`` property. Constraints: - For RDS for Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL - Must be a multiple between .5 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance. - For RDS for SQL Server - Must be a multiple between 1 and 50 of the storage amount for the DB instance.

If you enable the StorageEncrypted property but don't specify this property, AWS CloudFormation uses the default KMS key. If you specify this property, you must set the StorageEncrypted property to true. If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property, the value is inherited from the source DB instance if the read replica is created in the same region. If you create an encrypted read replica in a different AWS Region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS Region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they're created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one region in another region. If you specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The ``StorageEncrypted`` property value is inherited from the snapshot. If the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is also inherited from the snapshot. If you specify ``DBSecurityGroups`` , AWS CloudFormation ignores this property. To specify both a security group and this property, you must use a VPC security group. For more information about Amazon RDS and VPC, see `Using Amazon RDS with Amazon VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable.

        :param max_allocated_storage: The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see `Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIOPS.StorageTypes.html#USER_PIOPS.Autoscaling>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances: - Amazon Aurora (Storage is managed by the DB cluster.) - RDS Custom
        :param monitoring_interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. If ``MonitoringRoleArn`` is specified, then you must set ``MonitoringInterval`` to a value other than 0.

If ``MonitoringInterval`` is set to a value other than ``0`` , then you must supply a ``MonitoringRoleArn`` value. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param multi_az: Specifies whether the database instance is a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. You can't set the ``AvailabilityZone`` parameter if the ``MultiAZ`` parameter is set to true. For more information, see `Multi-AZ deployments for high availability <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. Amazon Aurora storage is replicated across all of the Availability Zones and doesn't require the ``MultiAZ`` option to be set.
        :param nchar_character_set_name: The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param network_type: The network type of the DB instance. Valid values: - ``IPV4`` - ``DUAL`` The network type is determined by the ``DBSubnetGroup`` specified for the DB instance. A ``DBSubnetGroup`` can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols ( ``DUAL`` ). For more information, see `Working with a DB instance in a VPC <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.*
        :param option_group_name: Indicates that the DB instance should be associated with the specified option group. Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed from an option group. Also, that option group can't be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with a DB instance.
        :param performance_insights_kms_key_id: The AWS KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you do not specify a value for ``PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId`` , then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default KMS key for each AWS Region. For information about enabling Performance Insights, see `EnablePerformanceInsights <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-enableperformanceinsights>`_ .
        :param performance_insights_retention_period: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: - ``7`` - *month* * 31, where *month* is a number of months from 1-23. Examples: ``93`` (3 months * 31), ``341`` (11 months * 31), ``589`` (19 months * 31) - ``731`` Default: ``7`` days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as ``94`` , Amazon RDS returns an error.
        :param port: The port number on which the database accepts connections. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The port number is managed by the DB cluster. *Db2* Default value: ``50000``
        :param preferred_backup_window: The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, using the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` parameter. For more information, see `Backup Window <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.BackupWindow>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* Constraints: - Must be in the format ``hh24:mi-hh24:mi`` . - Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). - Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window. - Must be at least 30 minutes. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster.
        :param preferred_maintenance_window: The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). Format: ``ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi`` The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week. To see the time blocks available, see `Adjusting the Preferred DB Instance Maintenance Window <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#AdjustingTheMaintenanceWindow>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide.* .. epigraph:: This property applies when AWS CloudFormation initially creates the DB instance. If you use AWS CloudFormation to update the DB instance, those updates are applied immediately. Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.
        :param processor_features: The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param promotion_tier: The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information, see `Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.AuroraHighAvailability.html#Aurora.Managing.FaultTolerance>`_ in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* . This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Default: ``1`` Valid Values: ``0 - 15`` Default: - 1
        :param publicly_accessible: Indicates whether the DB instance is an internet-facing instance. If you specify true, AWS CloudFormation creates an instance with a publicly resolvable DNS name, which resolves to a public IP address. If you specify false, AWS CloudFormation creates an internal instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. The default behavior value depends on your VPC setup and the database subnet group. For more information, see the ``PubliclyAccessible`` parameter in the `CreateDBInstance <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS API Reference* .
        :param replica_mode: The open mode of an Oracle read replica. For more information, see `Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . This setting is only supported in RDS for Oracle. Default: ``open-read-only`` Valid Values: ``open-read-only`` or ``mounted``
        :param restore_time: The date and time to restore from. Constraints: - Must be a time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) format. - Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance. - Can't be specified if the ``UseLatestRestorableTime`` parameter is enabled. Example: ``2009-09-07T23:45:00Z``
        :param source_db_cluster_identifier: The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas. Constraints: - Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster. - Can't be specified if the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` parameter is also specified. - The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0. - The source DB cluster must be in the same AWS Region as the read replica. Cross-Region replication isn't supported.
        :param source_db_instance_automated_backups_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replicated automated backups from which to restore, for example, ``arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEXAMPLE`` . This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
        :param source_db_instance_identifier: If you want to create a read replica DB instance, specify the ID of the source DB instance. Each DB instance can have a limited number of read replicas. For more information, see `Working with Read Replicas <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . For information about constraints that apply to DB instance identifiers, see `Naming constraints in Amazon RDS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Limits.html#RDS_Limits.Constraints>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . The ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property determines whether a DB instance is a read replica. If you remove the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property from your template and then update your stack, AWS CloudFormation promotes the Read Replica to a standalone DB instance. .. epigraph:: - If you specify a source DB instance that uses VPC security groups, we recommend that you specify the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property. If you don't specify the property, the read replica inherits the value of the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property from the source DB when you create the replica. However, if you update the stack, AWS CloudFormation reverts the replica's ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property to the default value because it's not defined in the stack's template. This change might cause unexpected issues. - Read replicas don't support deletion policies. AWS CloudFormation ignores any deletion policy that's associated with a read replica. - If you specify ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` , don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property. You can't create a read replica from a snapshot. - Don't set the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` , ``DBName`` , ``MasterUsername`` , ``MasterUserPassword`` , and ``PreferredBackupWindow`` properties. The database attributes are inherited from the source DB instance, and backups are disabled for read replicas. - If the source DB instance is in a different region than the read replica, specify the source region in ``SourceRegion`` , and specify an ARN for a valid DB instance in ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` . For more information, see `Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Tagging.html#USER_Tagging.ARN>`_ in the *Amazon RDS User Guide* . - For DB instances in Amazon Aurora clusters, don't specify this property. Amazon RDS automatically assigns writer and reader DB instances.
        :param source_dbi_resource_id: The resource ID of the source DB instance from which to restore.
        :param source_region: The ID of the region that contains the source DB instance for the read replica.
        :param storage_encrypted: A value that indicates whether the DB instance is encrypted. By default, it isn't encrypted. If you specify the ``KmsKeyId`` property, then you must enable encryption. If you specify the ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the source DB instance, and if the DB instance is encrypted, the specified ``KmsKeyId`` property is used. If you specify ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property, don't specify this property. The value is inherited from the snapshot. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB cluster.
        :param storage_throughput: Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting applies only to the ``gp3`` storage type. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.
        :param storage_type: The storage type to associate with the DB instance. If you specify ``io1`` , ``io2`` , or ``gp3`` , you must also include a value for the ``Iops`` parameter. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. Storage is managed by the DB cluster. Valid Values: ``gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard`` Default: ``io1`` , if the ``Iops`` parameter is specified. Otherwise, ``gp2`` .
        :param tags: An optional array of key-value pairs to apply to this DB instance.
        :param tde_credential_arn: 
        :param tde_credential_password: 
        :param timezone: The time zone of the DB instance. The time zone parameter is currently supported only by `RDS for Db2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/db2-time-zone>`_ and `RDS for SQL Server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.TimeZone>`_ .
        :param use_default_processor_features: Specifies whether the DB instance class of the DB instance uses its default processor features. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
        :param use_latest_restorable_time: Specifies whether the DB instance is restored from the latest backup time. By default, the DB instance isn't restored from the latest backup time. Constraints: - Can't be specified if the ``RestoreTime`` parameter is provided.
        :param vpc_security_groups: A list of the VPC security group IDs to assign to the DB instance. The list can include both the physical IDs of existing VPC security groups and references to `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group.html>`_ resources created in the template. If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC. If you set ``VPCSecurityGroups`` , you must not set ```DBSecurityGroups`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups>`_ , and vice versa. .. epigraph:: You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but keep the following in mind: - You can't revert to using an RDS security group after you establish a VPC security group membership. - When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack update rolls back because the DB instance update fails or because an update fails in another AWS CloudFormation resource, the rollback fails because it can't revert to an RDS security group. - To use the properties that are available when you use a VPC security group, you must recreate the DB instance. If you don't, AWS CloudFormation submits only the property values that are listed in the ```DBSecurityGroups`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups>`_ property. To avoid this situation, migrate your DB instance to using VPC security groups only when that is the only change in your stack template. *Amazon Aurora* Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is managed by the DB cluster. If specified, the setting must match the DB cluster setting.

           - If you specify a source DB instance that uses VPC security groups, we recommend that you specify the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property. If you don't specify the property, the read replica inherits the value of the ``VPCSecurityGroups`` property from the source DB when you create the replica.

           - If you specify ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` , don't specify the ``DBSnapshotIdentifier`` property. You can't create a read replica from a snapshot.
           - Don't set the ``BackupRetentionPeriod`` , ``DBName`` , ``MasterUsername`` , ``MasterUserPassword`` , and ``PreferredBackupWindow`` properties. The database attributes are inherited from the source DB instance, and backups are disabled for read replicas.
           - If the source DB instance is in a different region than the read replica, specify the source region in ``SourceRegion`` , and specify an ARN for a valid DB instance in ``SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`` .

        .. epigraph::

           You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but keep the following in mind:

           - You can't revert to using an RDS security group after you establish a VPC security group membership.
           - When you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack update rolls back because the DB instance update fails or because an update fails in another AWS CloudFormation resource, the rollback fails because it can't revert to an RDS security group.
           - To use the properties that are available when you use a VPC security group, you must recreate the DB instance. If you don't, AWS CloudFormation submits only the property values that are listed in the ```DBSecurityGroups`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html#cfn-rds-dbinstance-dbsecuritygroups>`_ property.

        To avoid this situation, migrate your DB instance to using VPC security groups only when that is the only change in your stack template.

An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
        :param engine_family: The kinds of databases that the proxy can connect to. This value determines which database network protocol the proxy recognizes when it interprets network traffic to and from the database. For Aurora MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, and RDS for MySQL databases, specify ``MYSQL`` . For Aurora PostgreSQL and RDS for PostgreSQL databases, specify ``POSTGRESQL`` . For RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, specify ``SQLSERVER`` . *Valid Values* : ``MYSQL`` | ``POSTGRESQL`` | ``SQLSERVER``
        :param role_arn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.
        :param vpc_subnet_ids: One or more VPC subnet IDs to associate with the new proxy.
        :param debug_logging: Specifies whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs.
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database.
        :param require_tls: Specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy.
        :param tags: An optional set of key-value pairs to associate arbitrary data of your choosing with the proxy.
        :param vpc_security_group_ids: One or more VPC security group IDs to associate with the new proxy. If you plan to update the resource, don't specify VPC security groups in a shared VPC.

This setting only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. For an unlimited wait time, specify ``0`` . Default: ``120`` Constraints: - Must be between 0 and 3600.

Typically used with ``SET`` statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single ``SET`` statement, such as ``SET x=1, y=2`` . Default: no initialization query

The value is expressed as a percentage of the ``max_connections`` setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. With a high value, the proxy leaves a high percentage of idle database connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close more idle connections and return them to the database. If you specify this parameter, then you must also include a value for ``MaxConnectionsPercent`` . Default: The default value is half of the value of ``MaxConnectionsPercent`` . For example, if ``MaxConnectionsPercent`` is 80, then the default value of ``MaxIdleConnectionsPercent`` is 40. If the value of ``MaxConnectionsPercent`` isn't specified, then for SQL Server, ``MaxIdleConnectionsPercent`` is ``5`` , and for all other engines, the default is ``50`` . Constraints: - Must be between 0 and the value of ``MaxConnectionsPercent`` .

    '''The ``AWS::RDS::DBSecurityGroupIngress`` resource enables ingress to a DB security group using one of two forms of authorization.

    First, you can add EC2 or VPC security groups to the DB security group if the application using the database is running on EC2 or VPC instances. Second, IP ranges are available if the application accessing your database is running on the Internet.

    This type supports updates. For more information about updating stacks, see `AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html>`_ .

    For details about the settings for DB security group ingress, see `AuthorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_AuthorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress.html>`_ .

       EC2-Classic was retired on August 15, 2022. If you haven't migrated from EC2-Classic to a VPC, we recommend that you migrate as soon as possible.

    The global database contains a single primary cluster with read-write capability, and a read-only secondary cluster that receives data from the primary cluster through high-speed replication performed by the Aurora storage subsystem.

    You can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it.

        '''Properties for ``DatabaseClusterFromSnapshot``.

        :param engine: What kind of database to start.
        :param snapshot_identifier: The identifier for the DB instance snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from. You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB instance snapshot.
        :param backtrack_window: The number of seconds to set a cluster's target backtrack window to. This feature is only supported by the Aurora MySQL database engine and cannot be enabled on existing clusters. Default: 0 seconds (no backtrack)
        :param backup: Backup settings. Default: - Backup retention period for automated backups is 1 day. Backup preferred window is set to a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.
        :param cloudwatch_logs_exports: The list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to CloudWatch Logs. Default: - no log exports
        :param cloudwatch_logs_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``Infinity``. Default: - logs never expire
        :param cloudwatch_logs_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - a new role is created.
        :param cluster_identifier: An optional identifier for the cluster. Default: - A name is automatically generated.
        :param copy_tags_to_snapshot: Whether to copy tags to the snapshot when a snapshot is created. Default: - true
        :param credentials: (deprecated) Credentials for the administrative user. Note - using this prop only works with ``Credentials.fromPassword()`` with the username of the snapshot, ``Credentials.fromUsername()`` with the username and password of the snapshot or ``Credentials.fromSecret()`` with a secret containing the username and password of the snapshot. Default: - A username of 'admin' (or 'postgres' for PostgreSQL) and SecretsManager-generated password that **will not be applied** to the cluster, use ``snapshotCredentials`` for the correct behavior.
        :param default_database_name: Name of a database which is automatically created inside the cluster. Default: - Database is not created in cluster.
        :param deletion_protection: Indicates whether the DB cluster should have deletion protection enabled. Default: - true if ``removalPolicy`` is RETAIN, ``undefined`` otherwise, which will not enable deletion protection. To disable deletion protection after it has been enabled, you must explicitly set this value to ``false``.
        :param domain: Directory ID for associating the DB cluster with a specific Active Directory. Necessary for enabling Kerberos authentication. If specified, the DB cluster joins the given Active Directory, enabling Kerberos authentication. If not specified, the DB cluster will not be associated with any Active Directory, and Kerberos authentication will not be enabled. Default: - DB cluster is not associated with an Active Directory; Kerberos authentication is not enabled.
        :param domain_role: The IAM role to be used when making API calls to the Directory Service. The role needs the AWS-managed policy ``AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`` or equivalent. Default: - If ``DatabaseClusterBaseProps.domain`` is specified, a role with the ``AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`` policy is automatically created.
        :param enable_data_api: Whether to enable the Data API for the cluster. Default: - false
        :param iam_authentication: Whether to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. Default: false
        :param instance_identifier_base: Base identifier for instances. Every replica is named by appending the replica number to this string, 1-based. Default: - clusterIdentifier is used with the word "Instance" appended. If clusterIdentifier is not provided, the identifier is automatically generated.
        :param instance_props: (deprecated) Settings for the individual instances that are launched.
        :param instances: (deprecated) How many replicas/instances to create. Has to be at least 1. Default: 2
        :param instance_update_behaviour: The ordering of updates for instances. Default: InstanceUpdateBehaviour.BULK
        :param monitoring_interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Amazon RDS collects enhanced monitoring metrics for the DB instances. Default: no enhanced monitoring
        :param monitoring_role: Role that will be used to manage DB instances monitoring. Default: - A role is automatically created for you
        :param network_type: The network type of the DB instance. Default: - IPV4
        :param parameter_group: Additional parameters to pass to the database engine. Default: - No parameter group.
        :param parameters: The parameters in the DBClusterParameterGroup to create automatically. You can only specify parameterGroup or parameters but not both. You need to use a versioned engine to auto-generate a DBClusterParameterGroup. Default: - None
        :param port: What port to listen on. Default: - The default for the engine is used.
        :param preferred_maintenance_window: A preferred maintenance window day/time range. Should be specified as a range ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). Example: 'Sun:23:45-Mon:00:15' Default: - 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.
        :param readers: A list of instances to create as cluster reader instances. Default: - no readers are created. The cluster will have a single writer/reader
        :param removal_policy: The removal policy to apply when the cluster and its instances are removed from the stack or replaced during an update. Default: - RemovalPolicy.SNAPSHOT (remove the cluster and instances, but retain a snapshot of the data)
        :param s3_export_buckets: S3 buckets that you want to load data into. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ExportRole`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - None
        :param s3_export_role: Role that will be associated with this DB cluster to enable S3 export. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ExportBuckets`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - New role is created if ``s3ExportBuckets`` is set, no role is defined otherwise
        :param s3_import_buckets: S3 buckets that you want to load data from. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ImportRole`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - None
        :param s3_import_role: Role that will be associated with this DB cluster to enable S3 import. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ImportBuckets`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - New role is created if ``s3ImportBuckets`` is set, no role is defined otherwise
        :param security_groups: Security group. Default: a new security group is created.
        :param serverless_v2_max_capacity: The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so on. The largest value that you can use is 128 (256GB). The maximum capacity must be higher than 0.5 ACUs. Default: 2
        :param serverless_v2_min_capacity: The minimum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on. The smallest value that you can use is 0.5. Default: 0.5
        :param snapshot_credentials: Master user credentials. Note - It is not possible to change the master username for a snapshot; however, it is possible to provide (or generate) a new password. Default: - The existing username and password from the snapshot will be used.
        :param storage_encrypted: Whether to enable storage encryption. Default: - true if storageEncryptionKey is provided, false otherwise
        :param storage_encryption_key: The KMS key for storage encryption. If specified, ``storageEncrypted`` will be set to ``true``. Default: - if storageEncrypted is true then the default master key, no key otherwise
        :param storage_type: The storage type to be associated with the DB cluster. Default: - DBClusterStorageType.AURORA_IOPT1
        :param subnet_group: Existing subnet group for the cluster. Default: - a new subnet group will be created.
        :param vpc: What subnets to run the RDS instances in. Must be at least 2 subnets in two different AZs.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the instances within the VPC. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified.
        :param writer: The instance to use for the cluster writer. Default: required if instanceProps is not provided

        :param backup: Backup settings. Default: - Backup retention period for automated backups is 1 day. Backup preferred window is set to a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.
        :param cloudwatch_logs_exports: The list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to CloudWatch Logs. Default: - no log exports
        :param cloudwatch_logs_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``Infinity``. Default: - logs never expire
        :param cloudwatch_logs_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - a new role is created.
        :param cluster_identifier: An optional identifier for the cluster. Default: - A name is automatically generated.
        :param copy_tags_to_snapshot: Whether to copy tags to the snapshot when a snapshot is created. Default: - true
        :param credentials: Credentials for the administrative user. Default: - A username of 'admin' (or 'postgres' for PostgreSQL) and SecretsManager-generated password
        :param default_database_name: Name of a database which is automatically created inside the cluster. Default: - Database is not created in cluster.
        :param deletion_protection: Indicates whether the DB cluster should have deletion protection enabled. Default: - true if ``removalPolicy`` is RETAIN, ``undefined`` otherwise, which will not enable deletion protection. To disable deletion protection after it has been enabled, you must explicitly set this value to ``false``.
        :param domain: Directory ID for associating the DB cluster with a specific Active Directory. Necessary for enabling Kerberos authentication. If specified, the DB cluster joins the given Active Directory, enabling Kerberos authentication. If not specified, the DB cluster will not be associated with any Active Directory, and Kerberos authentication will not be enabled. Default: - DB cluster is not associated with an Active Directory; Kerberos authentication is not enabled.
        :param domain_role: The IAM role to be used when making API calls to the Directory Service. The role needs the AWS-managed policy ``AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`` or equivalent. Default: - If ``DatabaseClusterBaseProps.domain`` is specified, a role with the ``AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`` policy is automatically created.
        :param enable_data_api: Whether to enable the Data API for the cluster. Default: - false
        :param iam_authentication: Whether to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. Default: false
        :param instance_identifier_base: Base identifier for instances. Every replica is named by appending the replica number to this string, 1-based. Default: - clusterIdentifier is used with the word "Instance" appended. If clusterIdentifier is not provided, the identifier is automatically generated.
        :param instance_props: (deprecated) Settings for the individual instances that are launched.
        :param instances: (deprecated) How many replicas/instances to create. Has to be at least 1. Default: 2
        :param instance_update_behaviour: The ordering of updates for instances. Default: InstanceUpdateBehaviour.BULK
        :param monitoring_interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Amazon RDS collects enhanced monitoring metrics for the DB instances. Default: no enhanced monitoring
        :param monitoring_role: Role that will be used to manage DB instances monitoring. Default: - A role is automatically created for you
        :param network_type: The network type of the DB instance. Default: - IPV4
        :param parameter_group: Additional parameters to pass to the database engine. Default: - No parameter group.
        :param parameters: The parameters in the DBClusterParameterGroup to create automatically. You can only specify parameterGroup or parameters but not both. You need to use a versioned engine to auto-generate a DBClusterParameterGroup. Default: - None
        :param port: What port to listen on. Default: - The default for the engine is used.
        :param preferred_maintenance_window: A preferred maintenance window day/time range. Should be specified as a range ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). Example: 'Sun:23:45-Mon:00:15' Default: - 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.
        :param readers: A list of instances to create as cluster reader instances. Default: - no readers are created. The cluster will have a single writer/reader
        :param removal_policy: The removal policy to apply when the cluster and its instances are removed from the stack or replaced during an update. Default: - RemovalPolicy.SNAPSHOT (remove the cluster and instances, but retain a snapshot of the data)
        :param s3_export_buckets: S3 buckets that you want to load data into. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ExportRole`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - None
        :param s3_export_role: Role that will be associated with this DB cluster to enable S3 export. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ExportBuckets`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - New role is created if ``s3ExportBuckets`` is set, no role is defined otherwise
        :param s3_import_buckets: S3 buckets that you want to load data from. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ImportRole`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - None
        :param s3_import_role: Role that will be associated with this DB cluster to enable S3 import. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ImportBuckets`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - New role is created if ``s3ImportBuckets`` is set, no role is defined otherwise
        :param security_groups: Security group. Default: a new security group is created.
        :param serverless_v2_max_capacity: The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so on. The largest value that you can use is 128 (256GB). The maximum capacity must be higher than 0.5 ACUs. Default: 2
        :param serverless_v2_min_capacity: The minimum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on. The smallest value that you can use is 0.5. Default: 0.5
        :param storage_encrypted: Whether to enable storage encryption. Default: - true if storageEncryptionKey is provided, false otherwise
        :param storage_encryption_key: The KMS key for storage encryption. If specified, ``storageEncrypted`` will be set to ``true``. Default: - if storageEncrypted is true then the default master key, no key otherwise
        :param storage_type: The storage type to be associated with the DB cluster. Default: - DBClusterStorageType.AURORA_IOPT1
        :param subnet_group: Existing subnet group for the cluster. Default: - a new subnet group will be created.
        :param vpc: What subnets to run the RDS instances in. Must be at least 2 subnets in two different AZs.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the instances within the VPC. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified.

        :param secrets: The secret that the proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster. These secrets are stored within Amazon Secrets Manager. One or more secrets are required.
        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Default: - Generated by CloudFormation (recommended)
        :param debug_logging: Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.

        '''Construction properties for a DatabaseProxy.

        :param secrets: The secret that the proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster. These secrets are stored within Amazon Secrets Manager. One or more secrets are required.
        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Default: - Generated by CloudFormation (recommended)
        :param debug_logging: Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.
        :param proxy_target: DB proxy target: Instance or Cluster.

        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Default: - Generated by CloudFormation (recommended)

This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.

        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region.

This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.

        :param id: -
        :param secrets: The secret that the proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster. These secrets are stored within Amazon Secrets Manager. One or more secrets are required.
        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Default: - Generated by CloudFormation (recommended)
        :param debug_logging: Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.

        :param unit: Unit used to filter the metric stream. Only refer to datums emitted to the metric stream with the given unit and ignore all others. Only useful when datums are being emitted to the same metric stream under different units. The default is to use all matric datums in the stream, regardless of unit, which is recommended in nearly all cases. CloudWatch does not honor this property for graphs.

        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Default: - Generated by CloudFormation (recommended)
        :param debug_logging: Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.

        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true

        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.

        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param engine: What kind of database to start.
        :param snapshot_identifier: The identifier for the DB instance snapshot or DB cluster snapshot to restore from. You can use either the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify a DB cluster snapshot. However, you can use only the ARN to specify a DB instance snapshot.
        :param backtrack_window: The number of seconds to set a cluster's target backtrack window to. This feature is only supported by the Aurora MySQL database engine and cannot be enabled on existing clusters. Default: 0 seconds (no backtrack)
        :param backup: Backup settings. Default: - Backup retention period for automated backups is 1 day. Backup preferred window is set to a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.
        :param cloudwatch_logs_exports: The list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to CloudWatch Logs. Default: - no log exports
        :param cloudwatch_logs_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``Infinity``. Default: - logs never expire
        :param cloudwatch_logs_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - a new role is created.

        :param copy_tags_to_snapshot: Whether to copy tags to the snapshot when a snapshot is created. Default: - true
        :param credentials: (deprecated) Credentials for the administrative user. Note - using this prop only works with ``Credentials.fromPassword()`` with the username of the snapshot, ``Credentials.fromUsername()`` with the username and password of the snapshot or ``Credentials.fromSecret()`` with a secret containing the username and password of the snapshot. Default: - A username of 'admin' (or 'postgres' for PostgreSQL) and SecretsManager-generated password that **will not be applied** to the cluster, use ``snapshotCredentials`` for the correct behavior.
        :param default_database_name: Name of a database which is automatically created inside the cluster. Default: - Database is not created in cluster.
        :param deletion_protection: Indicates whether the DB cluster should have deletion protection enabled. Default: - true if ``removalPolicy`` is RETAIN, ``undefined`` otherwise, which will not enable deletion protection. To disable deletion protection after it has been enabled, you must explicitly set this value to ``false``.
        :param domain: Directory ID for associating the DB cluster with a specific Active Directory. Necessary for enabling Kerberos authentication. If specified, the DB cluster joins the given Active Directory, enabling Kerberos authentication. If not specified, the DB cluster will not be associated with any Active Directory, and Kerberos authentication will not be enabled. Default: - DB cluster is not associated with an Active Directory; Kerberos authentication is not enabled.
        :param domain_role: The IAM role to be used when making API calls to the Directory Service. The role needs the AWS-managed policy ``AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`` or equivalent. Default: - If ``DatabaseClusterBaseProps.domain`` is specified, a role with the ``AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess`` policy is automatically created.
        :param enable_data_api: Whether to enable the Data API for the cluster. Default: - false
        :param iam_authentication: Whether to enable mapping of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts. Default: false
        :param instance_identifier_base: Base identifier for instances. Every replica is named by appending the replica number to this string, 1-based. Default: - clusterIdentifier is used with the word "Instance" appended. If clusterIdentifier is not provided, the identifier is automatically generated.
        :param instance_props: (deprecated) Settings for the individual instances that are launched.
        :param instances: (deprecated) How many replicas/instances to create. Has to be at least 1. Default: 2
        :param instance_update_behaviour: The ordering of updates for instances. Default: InstanceUpdateBehaviour.BULK
        :param monitoring_interval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Amazon RDS collects enhanced monitoring metrics for the DB instances. Default: no enhanced monitoring
        :param monitoring_role: Role that will be used to manage DB instances monitoring. Default: - A role is automatically created for you
        :param network_type: The network type of the DB instance. Default: - IPV4
        :param parameter_group: Additional parameters to pass to the database engine. Default: - No parameter group.
        :param parameters: The parameters in the DBClusterParameterGroup to create automatically. You can only specify parameterGroup or parameters but not both. You need to use a versioned engine to auto-generate a DBClusterParameterGroup. Default: - None
        :param port: What port to listen on. Default: - The default for the engine is used.
        :param preferred_maintenance_window: A preferred maintenance window day/time range. Should be specified as a range ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). Example: 'Sun:23:45-Mon:00:15' Default: - 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each AWS Region, occurring on a random day of the week.
        :param readers: A list of instances to create as cluster reader instances. Default: - no readers are created. The cluster will have a single writer/reader
        :param removal_policy: The removal policy to apply when the cluster and its instances are removed from the stack or replaced during an update. Default: - RemovalPolicy.SNAPSHOT (remove the cluster and instances, but retain a snapshot of the data)
        :param s3_export_buckets: S3 buckets that you want to load data into. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ExportRole`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - None
        :param s3_export_role: Role that will be associated with this DB cluster to enable S3 export. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ExportBuckets`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - New role is created if ``s3ExportBuckets`` is set, no role is defined otherwise
        :param s3_import_buckets: S3 buckets that you want to load data from. This feature is only supported by the Aurora database engine. This property must not be used if ``s3ImportRole`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - None

This property must not be used if ``s3ImportBuckets`` is used. For MySQL: Default: - New role is created if ``s3ImportBuckets`` is set, no role is defined otherwise
        :param security_groups: Security group. Default: a new security group is created.
        :param serverless_v2_max_capacity: The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so on. The largest value that you can use is 128 (256GB). The maximum capacity must be higher than 0.5 ACUs. Default: 2
        :param serverless_v2_min_capacity: The minimum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on. The smallest value that you can use is 0.5. Default: 0.5
        :param snapshot_credentials: Master user credentials. Note - It is not possible to change the master username for a snapshot; however, it is possible to provide (or generate) a new password. Default: - The existing username and password from the snapshot will be used.
        :param storage_encrypted: Whether to enable storage encryption. Default: - true if storageEncryptionKey is provided, false otherwise
        :param storage_encryption_key: The KMS key for storage encryption. If specified, ``storageEncrypted`` will be set to ``true``. Default: - if storageEncrypted is true then the default master key, no key otherwise
        :param storage_type: The storage type to be associated with the DB cluster. Default: - DBClusterStorageType.AURORA_IOPT1
        :param subnet_group: Existing subnet group for the cluster. Default: - a new subnet group will be created.
        :param vpc: What subnets to run the RDS instances in. Must be at least 2 subnets in two different AZs.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the instances within the VPC. Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified.
        :param writer: The instance to use for the cluster writer. Default: required if instanceProps is not provided

        :param id: -
        :param secrets: The secret that the proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster. These secrets are stored within Amazon Secrets Manager. One or more secrets are required.
        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Default: - Generated by CloudFormation (recommended)
        :param debug_logging: Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.

        :param vpc: The VPC to associate with the new proxy.
        :param borrow_timeout: The duration for a proxy to wait for a connection to become available in the connection pool. Only applies when the proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections are busy with client sessions. Value must be between 1 second and 1 hour, or ``Duration.seconds(0)`` to represent unlimited. Default: cdk.Duration.seconds(120)
        :param client_password_auth_type: Specifies the details of authentication used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply given the specified database engine.
        :param db_proxy_name: The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens. Default: - Generated by CloudFormation (recommended)
        :param debug_logging: Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs. Default: false
        :param iam_auth: Whether to require or disallow AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to the proxy. Default: false
        :param idle_client_timeout: The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database. Default: cdk.Duration.minutes(30)
        :param init_query: One or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new database connection. Typically used with SET statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings such as time zone and character set. For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator. You can also include multiple variables in a single SET statement, such as SET x=1, y=2. not currently supported for PostgreSQL. Default: - no initialization query
        :param max_connections_percent: The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target group. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. 1-100 Default: 100
        :param max_idle_connections_percent: Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database connections in the connection pool. A high value enables the proxy to leave a high percentage of idle connections open. A low value causes the proxy to close idle client connections and return the underlying database connections to the connection pool. For Aurora MySQL, it is expressed as a percentage of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. between 0 and MaxConnectionsPercent Default: 50
        :param require_tls: A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy. Default: true
        :param role: IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Default: - A role will automatically be created
        :param security_groups: One or more VPC security groups to associate with the new proxy. Default: - No security groups
        :param session_pinning_filters: Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning behavior. Default: - no session pinning filters
        :param vpc_subnets: The subnets used by the proxy. Default: - the VPC default strategy if not specified.
