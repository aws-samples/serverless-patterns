# Amazon S3 Construct Library

Define an S3 bucket.

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyFirstBucket")
```

`Bucket` constructs expose the following deploy-time attributes:

* `bucketArn` - the ARN of the bucket (i.e. `arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name`)
* `bucketName` - the name of the bucket (i.e. `bucket_name`)
* `bucketWebsiteUrl` - the Website URL of the bucket (i.e.
  `http://bucket_name.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com`)
* `bucketDomainName` - the URL of the bucket (i.e. `bucket_name.s3.amazonaws.com`)
* `bucketDualStackDomainName` - the dual-stack URL of the bucket (i.e.
  `bucket_name.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`)
* `bucketRegionalDomainName` - the regional URL of the bucket (i.e.
  `bucket_name.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com`)
* `arnForObjects(pattern)` - the ARN of an object or objects within the bucket (i.e.
  `arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/exampleobject.png` or
  `arn:aws:s3:::bucket_name/Development/*`)
* `urlForObject(key)` - the HTTP URL of an object within the bucket (i.e.
  `https://s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/china-bucket/mykey`)
* `virtualHostedUrlForObject(key)` - the virtual-hosted style HTTP URL of an object
  within the bucket (i.e. `https://china-bucket-s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/mykey`)
* `s3UrlForObject(key)` - the S3 URL of an object within the bucket (i.e.
  `s3://bucket/mykey`)

## Encryption

Define a KMS-encrypted bucket:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyEncryptedBucket",
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.KMS
)

# you can access the encryption key:
assert(bucket.encryption_key instanceof kms.Key)
```

You can also supply your own key:

```python
my_kms_key = kms.Key(self, "MyKey")

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyEncryptedBucket",
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.KMS,
    encryption_key=my_kms_key
)

assert(bucket.encryption_key == my_kms_key)
```

Enable KMS-SSE encryption via [S3 Bucket Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html):

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyEncryptedBucket",
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.KMS,
    bucket_key_enabled=True
)
```

Use `BucketEncryption.ManagedKms` to use the S3 master KMS key:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Buck",
    encryption=s3.BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED
)

assert(bucket.encryption_key == null)
```

Enable DSSE encryption:

```
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(stack, 'MyDSSEBucket', {
  encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.DSSE_MANAGED,
  bucketKeyEnabled: true,
});
```

## Permissions

A bucket policy will be automatically created for the bucket upon the first call to
`addToResourcePolicy(statement)`:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
result = bucket.add_to_resource_policy(
    iam.PolicyStatement(
        actions=["s3:GetObject"],
        resources=[bucket.arn_for_objects("file.txt")],
        principals=[iam.AccountRootPrincipal()]
    ))
```

If you try to add a policy statement to an existing bucket, this method will
not do anything:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(self, "existingBucket", "bucket-name")

# No policy statement will be added to the resource
result = bucket.add_to_resource_policy(
    iam.PolicyStatement(
        actions=["s3:GetObject"],
        resources=[bucket.arn_for_objects("file.txt")],
        principals=[iam.AccountRootPrincipal()]
    ))
```

That's because it's not possible to tell whether the bucket
already has a policy attached, let alone to re-use that policy to add more
statements to it. We recommend that you always check the result of the call:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
result = bucket.add_to_resource_policy(
    iam.PolicyStatement(
        actions=["s3:GetObject"],
        resources=[bucket.arn_for_objects("file.txt")],
        principals=[iam.AccountRootPrincipal()]
    ))

if not result.statement_added:
    pass
```

The bucket policy can be directly accessed after creation to add statements or
adjust the removal policy.

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
bucket.policy.apply_removal_policy(cdk.RemovalPolicy.RETAIN)
```

Most of the time, you won't have to manipulate the bucket policy directly.
Instead, buckets have "grant" methods called to give prepackaged sets of permissions
to other resources. For example:

```python
# my_lambda: lambda.Function


bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
bucket.grant_read_write(my_lambda)
```

Will give the Lambda's execution role permissions to read and write
from the bucket.

## AWS Foundational Security Best Practices

### Enforcing SSL

To require all requests use Secure Socket Layer (SSL):

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket",
    enforce_sSL=True
)
```

To require a minimum TLS version for all requests:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket",
    enforce_sSL=True,
    minimum_tLSVersion=1.2
)
```

## Sharing buckets between stacks

To use a bucket in a different stack in the same CDK application, pass the object to the other stack:

```python
#
# Stack that defines the bucket
#
class Producer(Stack):

    def __init__(self, scope, id, *, description=None, env=None, stackName=None, tags=None, synthesizer=None, terminationProtection=None, analyticsReporting=None, crossRegionReferences=None, permissionsBoundary=None, suppressTemplateIndentation=None):
        super().__init__(scope, id, description=description, env=env, stackName=stackName, tags=tags, synthesizer=synthesizer, terminationProtection=terminationProtection, analyticsReporting=analyticsReporting, crossRegionReferences=crossRegionReferences, permissionsBoundary=permissionsBoundary, suppressTemplateIndentation=suppressTemplateIndentation)

        bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
            removal_policy=cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
        )
        self.my_bucket = bucket

#
# Stack that consumes the bucket
#
class Consumer(Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope, id, *, userBucket, description=None, env=None, stackName=None, tags=None, synthesizer=None, terminationProtection=None, analyticsReporting=None, crossRegionReferences=None, permissionsBoundary=None, suppressTemplateIndentation=None):
        super().__init__(scope, id, userBucket=userBucket, description=description, env=env, stackName=stackName, tags=tags, synthesizer=synthesizer, terminationProtection=terminationProtection, analyticsReporting=analyticsReporting, crossRegionReferences=crossRegionReferences, permissionsBoundary=permissionsBoundary, suppressTemplateIndentation=suppressTemplateIndentation)

        user = iam.User(self, "MyUser")
        user_bucket.grant_read_write(user)

app = App()
producer = Producer(app, "ProducerStack")
Consumer(app, "ConsumerStack", user_bucket=producer.my_bucket)
```

## Importing existing buckets

To import an existing bucket into your CDK application, use the `Bucket.fromBucketAttributes`
factory method. This method accepts `BucketAttributes` which describes the properties of an already
existing bucket:

```python
# my_lambda: lambda.Function

bucket = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_attributes(self, "ImportedBucket",
    bucket_arn="arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
)

# now you can just call methods on the bucket
bucket.add_event_notification(s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED, s3n.LambdaDestination(my_lambda),
    prefix="home/myusername/*"
)
```

Alternatively, short-hand factories are available as `Bucket.fromBucketName` and
`Bucket.fromBucketArn`, which will derive all bucket attributes from the bucket
name or ARN respectively:

```python
by_name = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(self, "BucketByName", "my-bucket")
by_arn = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_arn(self, "BucketByArn", "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket")
```

The bucket's region defaults to the current stack's region, but can also be explicitly set in cases where one of the bucket's
regional properties needs to contain the correct values.

```python
my_cross_region_bucket = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_attributes(self, "CrossRegionImport",
    bucket_arn="arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket",
    region="us-east-1"
)
```

## Bucket Notifications

The Amazon S3 notification feature enables you to receive notifications when
certain events happen in your bucket as described under [S3 Bucket
Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) of the S3 Developer Guide.

To subscribe for bucket notifications, use the `bucket.addEventNotification` method. The
`bucket.addObjectCreatedNotification` and `bucket.addObjectRemovedNotification` can also be used for
these common use cases.

The following example will subscribe an SNS topic to be notified of all `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
topic = sns.Topic(self, "MyTopic")
bucket.add_event_notification(s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED, s3n.SnsDestination(topic))
```

This call will also ensure that the topic policy can accept notifications for
this specific bucket.

Supported S3 notification targets are exposed by the `aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-notifications` package.

It is also possible to specify S3 object key filters when subscribing. The
following example will notify `myQueue` when objects prefixed with `foo/` and
have the `.jpg` suffix are removed from the bucket.

```python
# my_queue: sqs.Queue

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
bucket.add_event_notification(s3.EventType.OBJECT_REMOVED, s3n.SqsDestination(my_queue),
    prefix="foo/",
    suffix=".jpg"
)
```

Adding notifications on existing buckets:

```python
# topic: sns.Topic

bucket = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_attributes(self, "ImportedBucket",
    bucket_arn="arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
)
bucket.add_event_notification(s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED, s3n.SnsDestination(topic))
```

When you add an event notification to a bucket, a custom resource is created to
manage the notifications. By default, a new role is created for the Lambda
function that implements this feature. If you want to use your own role instead,
you should provide it in the `Bucket` constructor:

```python
# my_role: iam.IRole

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    notifications_handler_role=my_role
)
```

Whatever role you provide, the CDK will try to modify it by adding the
permissions from `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` (an AWS managed policy) as well
as the permissions `s3:PutBucketNotification` and `s3:GetBucketNotification`.
If you’re passing an imported role, and you don’t want this to happen, configure
it to be immutable:

```python
imported_role = iam.Role.from_role_arn(self, "role", "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/RoleName",
    mutable=False
)
```

> If you provide an imported immutable role, make sure that it has at least all
> the permissions mentioned above. Otherwise, the deployment will fail!

### EventBridge notifications

Amazon S3 can send events to Amazon EventBridge whenever certain events happen in your bucket.
Unlike other destinations, you don't need to select which event types you want to deliver.

The following example will enable EventBridge notifications:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyEventBridgeBucket",
    event_bridge_enabled=True
)
```

## Block Public Access

Use `blockPublicAccess` to specify [block public access settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html) on the bucket.

Enable all block public access settings:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBlockedBucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL
)
```

Block and ignore public ACLs:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBlockedBucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS
)
```

Alternatively, specify the settings manually:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBlockedBucket",
    block_public_access=s3.BlockPublicAccess(block_public_policy=True)
)
```

When `blockPublicPolicy` is set to `true`, `grantPublicRead()` throws an error.

## Public Read Access

Use `publicReadAccess` to allow public read access to the bucket.

Note that to enable `publicReadAccess`, make sure both bucket-level and account-level block public access control is disabled.

Bucket-level block public access control can be configured through `blockPublicAccess` property. Account-level block public
access control can be configured on AWS Console -> S3 -> Block Public Access settings for this account (Navigation Panel).

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "Bucket",
    public_read_access=True,
    block_public_access={
        "block_public_policy": False,
        "block_public_acls": False,
        "ignore_public_acls": False,
        "restrict_public_buckets": False
    }
)
```

## Logging configuration

Use `serverAccessLogsBucket` to describe where server access logs are to be stored.

```python
access_logs_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "AccessLogsBucket")

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    server_access_logs_bucket=access_logs_bucket
)
```

It's also possible to specify a prefix for Amazon S3 to assign to all log object keys.

```python
access_logs_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "AccessLogsBucket")

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    server_access_logs_bucket=access_logs_bucket,
    server_access_logs_prefix="logs"
)
```

You have two options for the log object key format.
`Non-date-based partitioning` is the default log object key format and appears as follows:

```txt
[DestinationPrefix][YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[hh]-[mm]-[ss]-[UniqueString]
```

```python
access_logs_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "AccessLogsBucket")

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    server_access_logs_bucket=access_logs_bucket,
    server_access_logs_prefix="logs",
    # You can use a simple prefix with `TargetObjectKeyFormat.simplePrefix()`, but it is the same even if you do not specify `targetObjectKeyFormat` property.
    target_object_key_format=s3.TargetObjectKeyFormat.simple_prefix()
)
```

Another option is `Date-based partitioning`.
If you choose this format, you can select either the event time or the delivery time of the log file as the date source used in the log format.
This format appears as follows:

```txt
[DestinationPrefix][SourceAccountId]/[SourceRegion]/[SourceBucket]/[YYYY]/[MM]/[DD]/[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[hh]-[mm]-[ss]-[UniqueString]
```

```python
access_logs_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "AccessLogsBucket")

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    server_access_logs_bucket=access_logs_bucket,
    server_access_logs_prefix="logs",
    target_object_key_format=s3.TargetObjectKeyFormat.partitioned_prefix(s3.PartitionDateSource.EVENT_TIME)
)
```

### Allowing access log delivery using a Bucket Policy (recommended)

When possible, it is recommended to use a bucket policy to grant access instead of
using ACLs. When the `@aws-cdk/aws-s3:serverAccessLogsUseBucketPolicy` feature flag
is enabled, this is done by default for server access logs. If S3 Server Access Logs
are the only logs delivered to your bucket (or if all other services logging to the
bucket support using bucket policy instead of ACLs), you can set object ownership
to [bucket owner enforced](#bucket-owner-enforced-recommended), as is recommended.

```python
access_logs_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "AccessLogsBucket",
    object_ownership=s3.ObjectOwnership.BUCKET_OWNER_ENFORCED
)

bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    server_access_logs_bucket=access_logs_bucket,
    server_access_logs_prefix="logs"
)
```

## S3 Inventory

An [inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html) contains a list of the objects in the source bucket and metadata for each object. The inventory lists are stored in the destination bucket as a CSV file compressed with GZIP, as an Apache optimized row columnar (ORC) file compressed with ZLIB, or as an Apache Parquet (Parquet) file compressed with Snappy.

You can configure multiple inventory lists for a bucket. You can configure what object metadata to include in the inventory, whether to list all object versions or only current versions, where to store the inventory list file output, and whether to generate the inventory on a daily or weekly basis.

```python
inventory_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "InventoryBucket")

data_bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "DataBucket",
    inventories=[s3.Inventory(
        frequency=s3.InventoryFrequency.DAILY,
        include_object_versions=s3.InventoryObjectVersion.CURRENT,
        destination=s3.InventoryDestination(
            bucket=inventory_bucket
        )
    ), s3.Inventory(
        frequency=s3.InventoryFrequency.WEEKLY,
        include_object_versions=s3.InventoryObjectVersion.ALL,
        destination=s3.InventoryDestination(
            bucket=inventory_bucket,
            prefix="with-all-versions"
        )
    )
    ]
)
```

If the destination bucket is created as part of the same CDK application, the necessary permissions will be automatically added to the bucket policy.
However, if you use an imported bucket (i.e `Bucket.fromXXX()`), you'll have to make sure it contains the following policy document:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "InventoryAndAnalyticsExamplePolicy",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "s3:PutObject",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::destinationBucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Website redirection

You can use the two following properties to specify the bucket [redirection policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html#advanced-conditional-redirects). Please note that these methods cannot both be applied to the same bucket.

### Static redirection

You can statically redirect a to a given Bucket URL or any other host name with `websiteRedirect`:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyRedirectedBucket",
    website_redirect=s3.RedirectTarget(host_name="www.example.com")
)
```

### Routing rules

Alternatively, you can also define multiple `websiteRoutingRules`, to define complex, conditional redirections:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyRedirectedBucket",
    website_routing_rules=[s3.RoutingRule(
        host_name="www.example.com",
        http_redirect_code="302",
        protocol=s3.RedirectProtocol.HTTPS,
        replace_key=s3.ReplaceKey.prefix_with("test/"),
        condition=s3.RoutingRuleCondition(
            http_error_code_returned_equals="200",
            key_prefix_equals="prefix"
        )
    )
    ]
)
```

## Filling the bucket as part of deployment

To put files into a bucket as part of a deployment (for example, to host a
website), see the `aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-deployment` package, which provides a
resource that can do just that.

## The URL for objects

S3 provides two types of URLs for accessing objects via HTTP(S). Path-Style and
[Virtual Hosted-Style](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html)
URL. Path-Style is a classic way and will be
[deprecated](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story).
We recommend to use Virtual Hosted-Style URL for newly made bucket.

You can generate both of them.

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket")
bucket.url_for_object("objectname") # Path-Style URL
bucket.virtual_hosted_url_for_object("objectname") # Virtual Hosted-Style URL
bucket.virtual_hosted_url_for_object("objectname", regional=False)
```

## Object Ownership

You can use one of following properties to specify the bucket [object Ownership](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/about-object-ownership.html).

### Object writer

The Uploading account will own the object.

```python
s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    object_ownership=s3.ObjectOwnership.OBJECT_WRITER
)
```

### Bucket owner preferred

The bucket owner will own the object if the object is uploaded with the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL. Without this setting and canned ACL, the object is uploaded and remains owned by the uploading account.

```python
s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    object_ownership=s3.ObjectOwnership.BUCKET_OWNER_PREFERRED
)
```

### Bucket owner enforced (recommended)

ACLs are disabled, and the bucket owner automatically owns and has full control
over every object in the bucket. ACLs no longer affect permissions to data in the
S3 bucket. The bucket uses policies to define access control.

```python
s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    object_ownership=s3.ObjectOwnership.BUCKET_OWNER_ENFORCED
)
```

Some services may not not support log delivery to buckets that have object ownership
set to bucket owner enforced, such as
[S3 buckets using ACLs](#allowing-access-log-delivery-using-a-bucket-policy-recommended)
or [CloudFront Distributions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html#AccessLogsBucketAndFileOwnership).

## Bucket deletion

When a bucket is removed from a stack (or the stack is deleted), the S3
bucket will be removed according to its removal policy (which by default will
simply orphan the bucket and leave it in your AWS account). If the removal
policy is set to `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY`, the bucket will be deleted as long
as it does not contain any objects.

To override this and force all objects to get deleted during bucket deletion,
enable the`autoDeleteObjects` option.

When `autoDeleteObjects` is enabled, `s3:PutBucketPolicy` is added to the bucket policy. This is done to allow the custom resource this feature is built on to add a deny policy for `s3:PutObject` to the bucket policy when a delete stack event occurs. Adding this deny policy prevents new objects from being written to the bucket. Doing this prevents race conditions with external bucket writers during the deletion process.

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyTempFileBucket",
    removal_policy=cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
    auto_delete_objects=True
)
```

**Warning** if you have deployed a bucket with `autoDeleteObjects: true`,
switching this to `false` in a CDK version *before* `1.126.0` will lead to
all objects in the bucket being deleted. Be sure to update your bucket resources
by deploying with CDK version `1.126.0` or later **before** switching this value to `false`.

## Transfer Acceleration

[Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transfer-acceleration.html) can be configured to enable fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    transfer_acceleration=True
)
```

To access the bucket that is enabled for Transfer Acceleration, you must use a special endpoint. The URL can be generated using method `transferAccelerationUrlForObject`:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    transfer_acceleration=True
)
bucket.transfer_acceleration_url_for_object("objectname")
```

## Intelligent Tiering

[Intelligent Tiering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intelligent-tiering.html) can be configured to automatically move files to glacier:

```python
s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    intelligent_tiering_configurations=[s3.IntelligentTieringConfiguration(
        name="foo",
        prefix="folder/name",
        archive_access_tier_time=Duration.days(90),
        deep_archive_access_tier_time=Duration.days(180),
        tags=[s3.Tag(key="tagname", value="tagvalue")]
    )
    ]
)
```

## Lifecycle Rule

[Managing lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html) can be configured transition or expiration actions.

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    lifecycle_rules=[s3.LifecycleRule(
        abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_after=Duration.minutes(30),
        enabled=False,
        expiration=Duration.days(30),
        expiration_date=Date(),
        expired_object_delete_marker=False,
        id="id",
        noncurrent_version_expiration=Duration.days(30),

        # the properties below are optional
        noncurrent_versions_to_retain=123,
        noncurrent_version_transitions=[s3.NoncurrentVersionTransition(
            storage_class=s3.StorageClass.GLACIER,
            transition_after=Duration.days(30),

            # the properties below are optional
            noncurrent_versions_to_retain=123
        )
        ],
        object_size_greater_than=500,
        prefix="prefix",
        object_size_less_than=10000,
        transitions=[s3.Transition(
            storage_class=s3.StorageClass.GLACIER,

            # the properties below are optional
            transition_after=Duration.days(30),
            transition_date=Date()
        )
        ]
    )
    ]
)
```

## Object Lock Configuration

[Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html)
can be configured to enable a write-once-read-many model for an S3 bucket. Object Lock must be
configured when a bucket is created; if a bucket is created without Object Lock, it cannot be
enabled later via the CDK.

Object Lock can be enabled on an S3 bucket by specifying:

```python
bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyBucket",
    object_lock_enabled=True
)
```

Usually, it is desired to not just enable Object Lock for a bucket but to also configure a
[retention mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html#object-lock-retention-modes)
and a [retention period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-overview.html#object-lock-retention-periods).
These can be specified by providing `objectLockDefaultRetention`:

```python

        '''
        :param access_control: Specifies a canned ACL that grants predefined permissions to the bucket. Default: BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE
        :param auto_delete_objects: Whether all objects should be automatically deleted when the bucket is removed from the stack or when the stack is deleted. Requires the ``removalPolicy`` to be set to ``RemovalPolicy.DESTROY``. **Warning** if you have deployed a bucket with ``autoDeleteObjects: true``, switching this to ``false`` in a CDK version *before* ``1.126.0`` will lead to all objects in the bucket being deleted. Be sure to update your bucket resources by deploying with CDK version ``1.126.0`` or later **before** switching this value to ``false``. Setting ``autoDeleteObjects`` to true on a bucket will add ``s3:PutBucketPolicy`` to the bucket policy. This is because during bucket deletion, the custom resource provider needs to update the bucket policy by adding a deny policy for ``s3:PutObject`` to prevent race conditions with external bucket writers. Default: false
        :param block_public_access: The block public access configuration of this bucket. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply. New buckets and objects don't allow public access, but users can modify bucket policies or object permissions to allow public access
        :param bucket_key_enabled: Whether Amazon S3 should use its own intermediary key to generate data keys. Only relevant when using KMS for encryption. - If not enabled, every object GET and PUT will cause an API call to KMS (with the attendant cost implications of that). - If enabled, S3 will use its own time-limited key instead. Only relevant, when Encryption is not set to ``BucketEncryption.UNENCRYPTED``. Default: - false
        :param bucket_name: Physical name of this bucket. Default: - Assigned by CloudFormation (recommended).
        :param cors: The CORS configuration of this bucket. Default: - No CORS configuration.
        :param encryption: The kind of server-side encryption to apply to this bucket. If you choose KMS, you can specify a KMS key via ``encryptionKey``. If encryption key is not specified, a key will automatically be created. Default: - ``KMS`` if ``encryptionKey`` is specified, or ``UNENCRYPTED`` otherwise. But if ``UNENCRYPTED`` is specified, the bucket will be encrypted as ``S3_MANAGED`` automatically.
        :param encryption_key: External KMS key to use for bucket encryption. The ``encryption`` property must be either not specified or set to ``KMS`` or ``DSSE``. An error will be emitted if ``encryption`` is set to ``UNENCRYPTED`` or ``S3_MANAGED``. Default: - If ``encryption`` is set to ``KMS`` and this property is undefined, a new KMS key will be created and associated with this bucket.
        :param enforce_ssl: Enforces SSL for requests. S3.5 of the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices Regarding S3. Default: false
        :param event_bridge_enabled: Whether this bucket should send notifications to Amazon EventBridge or not. Default: false
        :param intelligent_tiering_configurations: Inteligent Tiering Configurations. Default: No Intelligent Tiiering Configurations.
        :param inventories: The inventory configuration of the bucket. Default: - No inventory configuration
        :param lifecycle_rules: Rules that define how Amazon S3 manages objects during their lifetime. Default: - No lifecycle rules.
        :param metrics: The metrics configuration of this bucket. Default: - No metrics configuration.
        :param minimum_tls_version: Enforces minimum TLS version for requests. Requires ``enforceSSL`` to be enabled. Default: No minimum TLS version is enforced.
        :param notifications_handler_role: The role to be used by the notifications handler. Default: - a new role will be created.
        :param object_lock_default_retention: The default retention mode and rules for S3 Object Lock. Default retention can be configured after a bucket is created if the bucket already has object lock enabled. Enabling object lock for existing buckets is not supported. Default: no default retention period
        :param object_lock_enabled: Enable object lock on the bucket. Enabling object lock for existing buckets is not supported. Object lock must be enabled when the bucket is created. Default: false, unless objectLockDefaultRetention is set (then, true)
        :param object_ownership: The objectOwnership of the bucket. Default: - No ObjectOwnership configuration, uploading account will own the object.
        :param public_read_access: Grants public read access to all objects in the bucket. Similar to calling ``bucket.grantPublicAccess()`` Default: false
        :param removal_policy: Policy to apply when the bucket is removed from this stack. Default: - The bucket will be orphaned.
        :param server_access_logs_bucket: Destination bucket for the server access logs. Default: - If "serverAccessLogsPrefix" undefined - access logs disabled, otherwise - log to current bucket.
        :param server_access_logs_prefix: Optional log file prefix to use for the bucket's access logs. If defined without "serverAccessLogsBucket", enables access logs to current bucket with this prefix. Default: - No log file prefix
        :param target_object_key_format: Optional key format for log objects. Default: - the default key format is: [DestinationPrefix][YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[hh]-[mm]-[ss]-[UniqueString]
        :param transfer_acceleration: Whether this bucket should have transfer acceleration turned on or not. Default: false
        :param versioned: Whether this bucket should have versioning turned on or not. Default: false (unless object lock is enabled, then true)
        :param website_error_document: The name of the error document (e.g. "404.html") for the website. ``websiteIndexDocument`` must also be set if this is set. Default: - No error document.
        :param website_index_document: The name of the index document (e.g. "index.html") for the website. Enables static website hosting for this bucket. Default: - No index document.
        :param website_redirect: Specifies the redirect behavior of all requests to a website endpoint of a bucket. If you specify this property, you can't specify "websiteIndexDocument", "websiteErrorDocument" nor , "websiteRoutingRules". Default: - No redirection.
        :param website_routing_rules: Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behavior. Default: - No redirection rules.

            An object key name is the name assigned to an object in your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify whether to filter on the suffix or prefix of the object key name. A prefix is a specific string of characters at the beginning of an object key name, which you can use to organize objects. For example, you can start the key names of related objects with a prefix, such as ``2023-`` or ``engineering/`` . Then, you can use ``FilterRule`` to find objects in a bucket with key names that have the same prefix. A suffix is similar to a prefix, but it is at the end of the object key name instead of at the beginning.

            :param name: The object key name prefix or suffix identifying one or more objects to which the filtering rule applies. The maximum length is 1,024 characters. Overlapping prefixes and suffixes are not supported. For more information, see `Configuring Event Notifications <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
            :param value: The value that the filter searches for in object key names.

               If you create the target resource and related permissions in the same template, you might have a circular dependency.

               For example, you might use the ``AWS::Lambda::Permission`` resource to grant the bucket permission to invoke an AWS Lambda function. However, AWS CloudFormation can't create the bucket until the bucket has permission to invoke the function ( AWS CloudFormation checks whether the bucket can invoke the function). If you're using Refs to pass the bucket name, this leads to a circular dependency.

               To avoid this dependency, you can create all resources without specifying the notification configuration. Then, update the stack with a notification configuration.

               For more information on permissions, see `AWS::Lambda::Permission <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-lambda-permission.html>`_ and `Granting Permissions to Publish Event Notification Messages to a Destination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html#grant-destinations-permissions-to-s3>`_ .

Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority. For more information, see `Replication <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

For an example configuration, see `Basic Rule Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-config-min-rule-config>`_ .

            For more information, see `Put Bucket Lifecycle Configuration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTlifecycle.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference* .

            You must specify at least one of the following properties: ``AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload`` , ``ExpirationDate`` , ``ExpirationInDays`` , ``NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays`` , ``NoncurrentVersionTransition`` , ``NoncurrentVersionTransitions`` , ``Transition`` , or ``Transitions`` .

            :param status: If ``Enabled`` , the rule is currently being applied. If ``Disabled`` , the rule is not currently being applied.
            :param abort_incomplete_multipart_upload: Specifies a lifecycle rule that stops incomplete multipart uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket.
            :param expiration_date: Indicates when objects are deleted from Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time.
            :param expiration_in_days: Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are deleted from Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time.
            :param expired_object_delete_marker: Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a delete marker without any noncurrent versions. If set to true, the delete marker will be removed if there are no noncurrent versions. This cannot be specified with ``ExpirationInDays`` , ``ExpirationDate`` , or ``TagFilters`` .
            :param id: Unique identifier for the rule. The value can't be longer than 255 characters.
            :param noncurrent_version_expiration: Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration, Amazon S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent object versions at a specific period in the object's lifetime.
            :param noncurrent_version_expiration_in_days: (Deprecated.) For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies the time, in days, between when a new version of the object is uploaded to the bucket and when old versions of the object expire. When object versions expire, Amazon S3 permanently deletes them. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time.
            :param noncurrent_version_transition: (Deprecated.) For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies when non-current objects transition to a specified storage class. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the ``NoncurrentVersionTransitions`` property.
            :param noncurrent_version_transitions: For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), one or more transition rules that specify when non-current objects transition to a specified storage class. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the ``NoncurrentVersionTransition`` property.
            :param object_size_greater_than: Specifies the minimum object size in bytes for this rule to apply to. Objects must be larger than this value in bytes. For more information about size based rules, see `Lifecycle configuration using size-based rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lc-size-rules>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
            :param object_size_less_than: Specifies the maximum object size in bytes for this rule to apply to. Objects must be smaller than this value in bytes. For more information about sized based rules, see `Lifecycle configuration using size-based rules <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html#lc-size-rules>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
            :param prefix: Object key prefix that identifies one or more objects to which this rule applies. .. epigraph:: Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see `XML related object key constraints <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints>`_ .
            :param tag_filters: Tags to use to identify a subset of objects to which the lifecycle rule applies.
            :param transition: (Deprecated.) Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the ``Transitions`` property.
            :param transitions: One or more transition rules that specify when an object transitions to a specified storage class. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. If you specify this property, don't specify the ``Transition`` property.

        :param access_control: .. epigraph:: This is a legacy property, and it is not recommended for most use cases. A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs, and we recommend that you keep ACLs disabled. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . A canned access control list (ACL) that grants predefined permissions to the bucket. For more information about canned ACLs, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . S3 buckets are created with ACLs disabled by default. Therefore, unless you explicitly set the `AWS::S3::OwnershipControls <https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-ownershipcontrols.html>`_ property to enable ACLs, your resource will fail to deploy with any value other than Private. Use cases requiring ACLs are uncommon. The majority of access control configurations can be successfully and more easily achieved with bucket policies. For more information, see `AWS::S3::BucketPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-policy.html>`_ . For examples of common policy configurations, including S3 Server Access Logs buckets and more, see `Bucket policy examples <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
        :param analytics_configurations: Specifies the configuration and any analyses for the analytics filter of an Amazon S3 bucket.
        :param bucket_encryption: Specifies default encryption for a bucket using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), AWS KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with KMS-managed keys (DSSE-KMS). For information about the Amazon S3 default encryption feature, see `Amazon S3 Default Encryption for S3 Buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
        :param bucket_name: A name for the bucket. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique ID and uses that ID for the bucket name. The bucket name must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), and dashes (-) and must follow `Amazon S3 bucket restrictions and limitations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html>`_ . For more information, see `Rules for naming Amazon S3 buckets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html#bucketnamingrules>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* . .. epigraph:: If you specify a name, you can't perform updates that require replacement of this resource. You can perform updates that require no or some interruption. If you need to replace the resource, specify a new name.
        :param cors_configuration: Describes the cross-origin access configuration for objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see `Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
        :param intelligent_tiering_configurations: Defines how Amazon S3 handles Intelligent-Tiering storage.
        :param inventory_configurations: Specifies the inventory configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see `GET Bucket inventory <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketGETInventoryConfig.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 API Reference* .
        :param lifecycle_configuration: Specifies the lifecycle configuration for objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see `Object Lifecycle Management <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .
        :param logging_configuration: Settings that define where logs are stored.
        :param metrics_configurations: Specifies a metrics configuration for the CloudWatch request metrics (specified by the metrics configuration ID) from an Amazon S3 bucket. If you're updating an existing metrics configuration, note that this is a full replacement of the existing metrics configuration. If you don't include the elements you want to keep, they are erased. For more information, see `PutBucketMetricsConfiguration <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTMetricConfiguration.html>`_ .
        :param notification_configuration: Configuration that defines how Amazon S3 handles bucket notifications.
        :param object_lock_configuration: .. epigraph:: This operation is not supported by directory buckets. Places an Object Lock configuration on the specified bucket. The rule specified in the Object Lock configuration will be applied by default to every new object placed in the specified bucket. For more information, see `Locking Objects <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html>`_ . .. epigraph:: - The ``DefaultRetention`` settings require both a mode and a period. - The ``DefaultRetention`` period can be either ``Days`` or ``Years`` but you must select one. You cannot specify ``Days`` and ``Years`` at the same time. - You can enable Object Lock for new or existing buckets. For more information, see `Configuring Object Lock <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock-configure.html>`_ .
        :param object_lock_enabled: Indicates whether this bucket has an Object Lock configuration enabled. Enable ``ObjectLockEnabled`` when you apply ``ObjectLockConfiguration`` to a bucket.
        :param ownership_controls: Configuration that defines how Amazon S3 handles Object Ownership rules.
        :param public_access_block_configuration: Configuration that defines how Amazon S3 handles public access.
        :param replication_configuration: Configuration for replicating objects in an S3 bucket. To enable replication, you must also enable versioning by using the ``VersioningConfiguration`` property. Amazon S3 can store replicated objects in a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. The destination bucket or buckets must already exist.
        :param tags: An arbitrary set of tags (key-value pairs) for this S3 bucket.
        :param versioning_configuration: Enables multiple versions of all objects in this bucket. You might enable versioning to prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten by mistake or to archive objects so that you can retrieve previous versions of them.
        :param website_configuration: Information used to configure the bucket as a static website. For more information, see `Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`_ .

   This is a legacy property, and it is not recommended for most use cases.

        A majority of modern use cases in Amazon S3 no longer require the use of ACLs, and we recommend that you keep ACLs disabled. For more information, see `Controlling object ownership <https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

        A canned access control list (ACL) that grants predefined permissions to the bucket. For more information about canned ACLs, see `Canned ACL <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl>`_ in the *Amazon S3 User Guide* .

        S3 buckets are created with ACLs disabled by default. Therefore, unless you explicitly set the `AWS::S3::OwnershipControls <https://docs.aws.amazon.com//AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket-ownershipcontrols.html>`_ property to enable ACLs, your resource will fail to deploy with any value other than Private. Use cases requiring ACLs are uncommon.

        The majority of access control configurations can be successfully and more easily achieved with bucket policies.

        :param abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_after: Specifies a lifecycle rule that aborts incomplete multipart uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket. The AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload property type creates a lifecycle rule that aborts incomplete multipart uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket. When Amazon S3 aborts a multipart upload, it deletes all parts associated with the multipart upload. The underlying configuration is expressed in whole numbers of days. Providing a Duration that does not represent a whole number of days will result in a runtime or deployment error. Default: - Incomplete uploads are never aborted
        :param enabled: Whether this rule is enabled. Default: true
        :param expiration: Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are deleted from Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. The underlying configuration is expressed in whole numbers of days. Providing a Duration that does not represent a whole number of days will result in a runtime or deployment error. Default: - No expiration timeout
        :param expiration_date: Indicates when objects are deleted from Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier. The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight UTC. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. Default: - No expiration date
        :param expired_object_delete_marker: Indicates whether Amazon S3 will remove a delete marker with no noncurrent versions. If set to true, the delete marker will be expired. Default: false
        :param id: A unique identifier for this rule. The value cannot be more than 255 characters.
        :param noncurrent_version_expiration: Time between when a new version of the object is uploaded to the bucket and when old versions of the object expire. For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies the time, in days, between when a new version of the object is uploaded to the bucket and when old versions of the object expire. When object versions expire, Amazon S3 permanently deletes them. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time. The underlying configuration is expressed in whole numbers of days. Providing a Duration that does not represent a whole number of days will result in a runtime or deployment error. Default: - No noncurrent version expiration
        :param noncurrent_versions_to_retain: Indicates a maximum number of noncurrent versions to retain. If there are this many more noncurrent versions, Amazon S3 permanently deletes them. Default: - No noncurrent versions to retain
        :param noncurrent_version_transitions: One or more transition rules that specify when non-current objects transition to a specified storage class. Only for for buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended). If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time.
        :param object_size_greater_than: Specifies the minimum object size in bytes for this rule to apply to. Objects must be larger than this value in bytes. Default: - No rule
        :param object_size_less_than: Specifies the maximum object size in bytes for this rule to apply to. Objects must be smaller than this value in bytes. Default: - No rule
        :param prefix: Object key prefix that identifies one or more objects to which this rule applies. Default: - Rule applies to all objects
        :param tag_filters: The TagFilter property type specifies tags to use to identify a subset of objects for an Amazon S3 bucket. Default: - Rule applies to all objects
        :param transitions: One or more transition rules that specify when an object transitions to a specified storage class. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. Default: - No transition rules

        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param access_control: Specifies a canned ACL that grants predefined permissions to the bucket. Default: BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE
        :param auto_delete_objects: Whether all objects should be automatically deleted when the bucket is removed from the stack or when the stack is deleted. Requires the ``removalPolicy`` to be set to ``RemovalPolicy.DESTROY``. **Warning** if you have deployed a bucket with ``autoDeleteObjects: true``, switching this to ``false`` in a CDK version *before* ``1.126.0`` will lead to all objects in the bucket being deleted. Be sure to update your bucket resources by deploying with CDK version ``1.126.0`` or later **before** switching this value to ``false``. Setting ``autoDeleteObjects`` to true on a bucket will add ``s3:PutBucketPolicy`` to the bucket policy. This is because during bucket deletion, the custom resource provider needs to update the bucket policy by adding a deny policy for ``s3:PutObject`` to prevent race conditions with external bucket writers. Default: false
        :param block_public_access: The block public access configuration of this bucket. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply. New buckets and objects don't allow public access, but users can modify bucket policies or object permissions to allow public access
        :param bucket_key_enabled: Whether Amazon S3 should use its own intermediary key to generate data keys. Only relevant when using KMS for encryption. - If not enabled, every object GET and PUT will cause an API call to KMS (with the attendant cost implications of that). - If enabled, S3 will use its own time-limited key instead. Only relevant, when Encryption is not set to ``BucketEncryption.UNENCRYPTED``. Default: - false
        :param bucket_name: Physical name of this bucket. Default: - Assigned by CloudFormation (recommended).
        :param cors: The CORS configuration of this bucket. Default: - No CORS configuration.
        :param encryption: The kind of server-side encryption to apply to this bucket. If you choose KMS, you can specify a KMS key via ``encryptionKey``. If encryption key is not specified, a key will automatically be created. Default: - ``KMS`` if ``encryptionKey`` is specified, or ``UNENCRYPTED`` otherwise. But if ``UNENCRYPTED`` is specified, the bucket will be encrypted as ``S3_MANAGED`` automatically.
        :param encryption_key: External KMS key to use for bucket encryption. The ``encryption`` property must be either not specified or set to ``KMS`` or ``DSSE``. An error will be emitted if ``encryption`` is set to ``UNENCRYPTED`` or ``S3_MANAGED``. Default: - If ``encryption`` is set to ``KMS`` and this property is undefined, a new KMS key will be created and associated with this bucket.
        :param enforce_ssl: Enforces SSL for requests. S3.5 of the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices Regarding S3. Default: false
        :param event_bridge_enabled: Whether this bucket should send notifications to Amazon EventBridge or not. Default: false
        :param intelligent_tiering_configurations: Inteligent Tiering Configurations. Default: No Intelligent Tiiering Configurations.
        :param inventories: The inventory configuration of the bucket. Default: - No inventory configuration
        :param lifecycle_rules: Rules that define how Amazon S3 manages objects during their lifetime. Default: - No lifecycle rules.
        :param metrics: The metrics configuration of this bucket. Default: - No metrics configuration.
        :param minimum_tls_version: Enforces minimum TLS version for requests. Requires ``enforceSSL`` to be enabled. Default: No minimum TLS version is enforced.
        :param notifications_handler_role: The role to be used by the notifications handler. Default: - a new role will be created.
        :param object_lock_default_retention: The default retention mode and rules for S3 Object Lock. Default retention can be configured after a bucket is created if the bucket already has object lock enabled. Enabling object lock for existing buckets is not supported. Default: no default retention period
        :param object_lock_enabled: Enable object lock on the bucket. Enabling object lock for existing buckets is not supported. Object lock must be enabled when the bucket is created. Default: false, unless objectLockDefaultRetention is set (then, true)
        :param object_ownership: The objectOwnership of the bucket. Default: - No ObjectOwnership configuration, uploading account will own the object.
        :param public_read_access: Grants public read access to all objects in the bucket. Similar to calling ``bucket.grantPublicAccess()`` Default: false
        :param removal_policy: Policy to apply when the bucket is removed from this stack. Default: - The bucket will be orphaned.
        :param server_access_logs_bucket: Destination bucket for the server access logs. Default: - If "serverAccessLogsPrefix" undefined - access logs disabled, otherwise - log to current bucket.
        :param server_access_logs_prefix: Optional log file prefix to use for the bucket's access logs. If defined without "serverAccessLogsBucket", enables access logs to current bucket with this prefix. Default: - No log file prefix
        :param target_object_key_format: Optional key format for log objects. Default: - the default key format is: [DestinationPrefix][YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[hh]-[mm]-[ss]-[UniqueString]
        :param transfer_acceleration: Whether this bucket should have transfer acceleration turned on or not. Default: false
        :param versioned: Whether this bucket should have versioning turned on or not. Default: false (unless object lock is enabled, then true)
        :param website_error_document: The name of the error document (e.g. "404.html") for the website. ``websiteIndexDocument`` must also be set if this is set. Default: - No error document.
        :param website_index_document: The name of the index document (e.g. "index.html") for the website. Enables static website hosting for this bucket. Default: - No index document.
        :param website_redirect: Specifies the redirect behavior of all requests to a website endpoint of a bucket. If you specify this property, you can't specify "websiteIndexDocument", "websiteErrorDocument" nor , "websiteRoutingRules". Default: - No redirection.
        :param website_routing_rules: Rules that define when a redirect is applied and the redirect behavior. Default: - No redirection rules.

The AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload property type creates a lifecycle rule that aborts incomplete multipart uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket. When Amazon S3 aborts a multipart upload, it deletes all parts associated with the multipart upload. The underlying configuration is expressed in whole numbers of days. Providing a Duration that does not represent a whole number of days will result in a runtime or deployment error. Default: - Incomplete uploads are never aborted

If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time. The underlying configuration is expressed in whole numbers of days. Providing a Duration that does not represent a whole number of days will result in a runtime or deployment error. Default: - No expiration timeout

Default: - No expiration date

        :param id: A unique identifier for this rule. The value cannot be more than 255 characters.
        :param noncurrent_version_expiration: Time between when a new version of the object is uploaded to the bucket and when old versions of the object expire. For buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended), specifies the time, in days, between when a new version of the object is uploaded to the bucket and when old versions of the object expire. When object versions expire, Amazon S3 permanently deletes them. If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time. The underlying configuration is expressed in whole numbers of days. Providing a Duration that does not represent a whole number of days will result in a runtime or deployment error. Default: - No noncurrent version expiration
        :param noncurrent_versions_to_retain: Indicates a maximum number of noncurrent versions to retain. If there are this many more noncurrent versions, Amazon S3 permanently deletes them. Default: - No noncurrent versions to retain
        :param noncurrent_version_transitions: One or more transition rules that specify when non-current objects transition to a specified storage class. Only for for buckets with versioning enabled (or suspended). If you specify a transition and expiration time, the expiration time must be later than the transition time.
        :param object_size_greater_than: Specifies the minimum object size in bytes for this rule to apply to. Objects must be larger than this value in bytes. Default: - No rule
        :param object_size_less_than: Specifies the maximum object size in bytes for this rule to apply to. Objects must be smaller than this value in bytes. Default: - No rule
        :param prefix: Object key prefix that identifies one or more objects to which this rule applies. Default: - Rule applies to all objects

        :param transitions: One or more transition rules that specify when an object transitions to a specified storage class. If you specify an expiration and transition time, you must use the same time unit for both properties (either in days or by date). The expiration time must also be later than the transition time.
