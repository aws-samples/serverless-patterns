  "title": "Exponential Backoff in SQS Processing with Step Functions and EventBridge Pipes",
  "description": "This pattern demonstrates a seamless integration between an SQS queue and AWS Step Functions using Amazon EventBridge Pipes. It enables direct routing of messages from an SQS queue into a Step Functions state machine, which orchestrates the processing flow and manages AWS Lambda invocation errors. When Lambda encounters an error, the erroneous message is directed to an SQS Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for further inspection or reprocessing.",

    "headline": "How it works",
    "text": [
      "Messages sent to the SQS queue are routed through EventBridge Pipes to a Step Functions state machine. The state machine manages message processing and invokes a Lambda function, which is intentionally set with a reserved concurrency of 0 to simulate throttling.",
      "When errors, such as throttling, occur in the Lambda function, the state machine employs an exponential backoff retry strategy that starts with a 5-second delay, doubling this delay after each subsequent retry, for up to 6 maximum retry attempts. If all retry attempts are exhausted, the message is directed to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for further analysis."
