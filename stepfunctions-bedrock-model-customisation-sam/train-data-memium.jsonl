But they are glad I called them.\n#Person2#: What were they doing when you called?\n#Person1#: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, they could have all been killed.\n#Person2#: That's terrible.

That's impossible.\n#Person2#: What would you suggest?\n#Person1#: The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars.

In fact, we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade.\n#Person1#: I'm glad to hear that.

Sounds a little strange.\n#Person2#: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n#Person1#: That's a pretty long span of time.\n#Person2#: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: 'Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.'\n#Person1#: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell?\n#Person2#: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size.\n#Person1#: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens?\n#Person2#: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine?\n#Person1#: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n#Person2#: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans.

Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm?\n#Person2#: I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs.

{"prompt": "Summarize the following conversation.\n\n#Person1#: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr. Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n#Person2#: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n#Person1#: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n#Person2#: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n#Person1#: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n#Person2#: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n#Person1#: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n#Person2#: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.","completion":"#Person1# have an interview with Dr. Ann Winters, an expert on human memory. Ann first explains that human memory is a compartment in people's brains to store images. She says memory can be infected by diseases or accidents and doing brain exercise can keep the brain young.

And turning to the new channel..., which type of programmes would you like to see more of?\n#Person2#: Well, I certainly don't think we need any more factual programmes like news and documentaries. I think we need more about things like local information..., you know, providing a service for the community. And in the same vein, perhaps more for younger viewers..., you know, good quality stuff.\n#Person1#: Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up the channel, what advice would you give them?\n#Person2#: I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast, you know, the sound system.

He said she makes really good sushi. \n#Person1#: Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course. \n#Person2#: Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi? \n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. \n#Person2#: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right? \n#Person1#: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet.

What's that? \n#Person1#: That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay. \n#Person2#: Let's see.

We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but. . . this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. \n#Person2#: All right. What varietal is that? \n#Person1#: Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. \n#Person2#: And you think this is a good wine? \n#Person1#: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma. \n#Person2#: Perfect! I'll take it!
