      "This sample project demonstrates how to use an AWS Step Functions state machine to call an on-premises API without using an intermediary Lambda function. This pattern is leveraging EventBridge connection to connect to an HTTP endpoint and VPC Lattice to access private resources (in a VPC or on premises).",
      "This pattern deploys one Step Functions, one EventBridge connection, a VPC Lattice resource configuration and resource gateway. You need to have a connection between a VPC and a datacenter (using VPN or Direct Connect)."
