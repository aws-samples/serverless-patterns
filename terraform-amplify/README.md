# Automating Deployment of AWS Amplify Apps with Terraform

In This pattern you will create a serverless fullstack Amplify App, backed by an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and deploy it all with Terraform! The application will include Storage, a Database, Authentication, and an API. You will also learn how to leverage the Amplify Client libraries, and experience the process for customizing the Amplify App.
