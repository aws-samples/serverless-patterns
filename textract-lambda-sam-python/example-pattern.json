        "This pattern allows you to store image files in an Amazon S3 bucket, which triggers the workflow. Upon an object being created in the S3 bucket, a Lambda function is invoked, which initiates Amazon Textracts's DetectDocumentText function. Once the function call is finished and it has retrieved any text found within the file, the Lambda function stores this information in our DynamoDB table.",
