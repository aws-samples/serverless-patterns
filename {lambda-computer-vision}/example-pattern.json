      "This sample project demonstrates how to use Amazon Machine learning to ingest and analyze images of equipment from the edge and provide ML inferences based on customizable business logic. Your images are ingested into Amazon S3 and trigger a lambda to run a ML inference using Amazon rekognition. ",
      "With Amazon Rekognition you can create a custom model based on the equipment you are analyzing with computer vision. After you provide you custom labels endpoint, Rekognition will use that model to make predictive maintenance suggestions.",
      "The results of that inference will be stored in an Amazon DynamoDB table and sent to Amazon SNS for notification via email."
